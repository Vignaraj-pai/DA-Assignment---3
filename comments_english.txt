What before that cryingface what happened after grinningfacewithsweat  where are we going with this
This is incorrect Israel only declared the small area just 657th in size compared to the area held by the muslims bation surrounding israels land just 90 miles north and south by 20 miles east and west Palistine is a name given the region by the Romans
no
Free Palestine
If the Arabs lay down their arms there will be no more war If Israel lays down its arms there will be no more State of Israel
There are Arabs in Israel living alongside Jews Christians Muslims Bedouins Druze All are different Arabs Who are the Palestinians
This is islam vs judaism The last great holy war
Alot of comments blaming UK gtGet your head out the pastlt
So Palestine doen39t exist facewithtearsofjoy  still they think thay do after loosing 3 wars amazing
How far has hamas and Israel
How far
US brUK  brthe entirety of the modern day West brGazabrthe Holy Land JerusalembrBethlehem brWeimar Germany brbrall the same people all the same suspects all the same problems
In israel the jews from Europe are much less than half In israel there are jews from India from Ethiopia from yemen from irak from marocco Algeria Tunis and Lydia
Theres probably a really simple reason against this but disregarding the fact that both sides want the other destroyed wouldnt a good solution to be using the original British recommendation of separation of the lands allowing both peoples their own lands Please correct me if Im wrong but it just seems so simple that it feels strange it wasnt taken into considerations during any peace negotiations as far as I know
So basically if Arab had allowed the Israelis to live in peace the ArabIsraieli war wouldn39t have happened and Israel wouldn39t have taken Palestinian land
What39s time title of the piano pice in this video that starts from a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchviRYZjOuUnlUampt135215aa hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchviRYZjOuUnlUampt229349a
The Farhud in irak took place in 1941 the Trital in marocco took place in 1912 The jews in the arabs countries lived there for generations unlike the srabs in palestina A distinction  must be made between the arabs who lived in the west bank who really lived there for generations and the arabs who immigrated to the territory of 1948 who immigrated from arabs countries during the ottoman period most of them from the end of the 19h century

Free Palestine
First of all most the jews who live in israel today came from arabs countries It is true that most jews in the world are jews from Europe but in israel most jews came from arabs countries They suffered pogroms and humiliations there saw the Farhud in irak see the Trital in marocco in the city of Fez pogroms in Libya Algeria and yemen As for the jews who came from Europe  they are now a minority  in israel and there are many who mixed with jews from arabs countries From a genetic point of view today it can be determined that the Ashkenazi jews have between 15 to 45 of their origin from the middle East and the rest from southern Italy and only a little north Europe 15  25
Free Palestine brWho agrees
genuine questions how do ppl in that territorry tell palestinians ans israeli ppl apart and hmm both sides are bombing their own territory and how are more palestinians diying if teveryone is mixed up 
every time I try to understand this I find it super confusing brI have to keep track of a few religions a few geographic regions a few governments and a terrorist group  
you are good liar actually i would scam if i didn39t study history about israel goals and what made british sell palestine to some jews
There is WAY more context if you go back farther not just covering the most recent activities
You are skipping the issue of Jordan This was also part of the Palestine Mandate
Your maps have some error The British mandate for Palestine included Transjordan current kingdom of Jordan It was only when the Ishemites lost their territories in Saudi Arabia that the state of Jordan was give to the Ishaemite dynasty
Palestine redheart 
Its not about land  Nobody has a nation that gets excited about murder  If that happened in Americayoure done
so is it basically a war that started based on hatred towards another39s religion
This is NOT a war about land or occupation This is a war of ideology Palestinians still believe that Israel needs to be removed from the land until that ends all the side issues like occupation settlers Jerusalem etc are irrelevant until the ideology changes  Its the unfortunate truth
when you say many jews were expelled from Arab countries its safe to say at least 700000 were ethically cleansed from the countries they were born in and lived
Another thing when britain received the mandate over the region  it divided palestina into two parts The eastern part gave to the Hashemite family from Saudi arabia in exchange for their help in first world war This is how the state of jordan was created which is actually part of palestina Most of the Jordanians are palastinian
During the ottoman rule the entire area that is now syria jordan and israel was called syria palestina and there were no borders the Arabs called themselves arabs not palestinian They considered themselves part of big syria  See the sies pico agreement from 1916 which divided  the territory between Fran and britain and created new countries See olso the agreement from the Paris peace conference of 1919 in which the arabs and the jews agreed on a Jewish state where Israel today includes the west bank and the will receive a large arab state where today syria and jordan The agreement failed only when the arab learned that syria had been given to france in sies pico agreement
It need to be corrected most the arabs did not live for generations in the territory of the 1948 borders When the jews settled in 1882 most of the Texas uninhabitable there were many diseases such as malaria The jews dry swamps and made the area habitable Most of the Arabs arrived in the area later when the place developed
Thanks for such comprehensive assessment for a very long conflict have been established over 75 years of oppression My concern as follows br1 UK is the starting driver in  through conflict and started by Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British Government in 1917 during the First World War announcing its support for establishing Jewish community in Palastein At that time total Jewish expelled from Europe was 50K while palastenian were 650K brbrEurope expelling unwanted Jewish to settle them away brbr2 October war br3 President sadat role in restoring Egyptian land and proposing the first two state solution in 1977 in Camb David treaty brbrFinally Uk start the bad vision  Kick Jewish from Europe  USA maintain the support and American tax payers will finance the project for ever

brDON39T LET ANYONE CONVINCE YOU THAT IT STARTED ON OCTOBER 7TH
While the timeline and events are accurate there is a lot of opinion in this video
I don39t support anybody I support peace countries shouldnt support anyone They should support peace Its the only way
This report is Antisemitic pro Arabsfacewithtearsofjoy  This channel most probably funded by Qatar Iran facewithtearsofjoy 
from religion to region
Please grant victory to our people in palestine
No words could describe the horror that came
This video should be shown to anyone who thinks this started on Oct 7
All started when these arabs rejected the UN plan When Jews fought back and they lost they now cry
The background music is too loud
Many mistakes to name a few  in 1967 Israel and the Arabs did not fight a war  Israel attacked its neighbours and stole their lands  And you forgot to mention that in 73 Egypt and Syria fought back and destroyed the Israel Barliev defence on the Suez canal resulting in a cease fire and then the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel  Hamas was funded by Netanyahu to create a division in the Palestinian authority by his own admission
A very important reasonUnited Nations Partition Plan for PalestineThe United States and Western countries as well as the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries agreed to this proposal while all Arab countries opposed it and China and Britain abstained The controversial proposal was passed with a vote of a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchviRYZjOuUnlUampt19933313a allowing for the establishment of the state of Israel
RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES The Koran celebrates and glorifies the massacre of the Jewish tribe that inhabited the Arabian Peninsula at the beginning of Islam a massacre led and carried out by Muhammad himself But Muslims don39t tell you about those religious differences
More than this the Palestinians have been suffering for more than 70 years killing displacement seizing their lands and displacing them I challenge you to give us how many civilians were killed by Hamas As for the Palestinian civilian victims children women and the elderly who were exterminated by barbaric bombing Israeli terrorist numbers in the tens of thousands
israel offered a part of land to palestine that39s proof of the occupationfacewithtearsofjoy 
Look up the sykes picot aggrement its really why the middle east is in its state today
You go back only 100 years Haha wow as if I needed more of a clue that this video is a complete joke

STOP BRINING FIRE AGAINST ISRAELIS AND JEWS AROUND THE WORLD BC OF JEWISH SETTLERS IN THE WEST BANK THEY ARE NOT A PART OF OUR AGENDA
1 it goes much before the beginning of 19th centurybr2 arabs were a minority in israel before the 19th century br3tension between jews and arabs was not the reason for the brits to stop jewish immigration but rather the quick pace in which they built new villages in areas were NO ONE LIVED and from SCRATCH br4  assuming jews are Europeans is incorrect and not a good reason for the mass murder of jews by muslim arabs all over arab countries due to the establishment of the jewish state br5   The expelled arabs were able to return back home but decided not to Just as today even israelis in a war zone are evacuated from their homes including mr Hadid and his family do not mislead
free israel
free palestine
I39m assuming that if the Native Americans decide to  quotcome homequot United States nonnatives will move gladly into a walledoff prison of a city totally reliant on others for day to day life I mean it WAS their original homeland FAR longer than that of the invading BritainsEuropeans
As sad as it is I don39t think this conflict will ever end well one side will probably destroy the other
Excellent video especially showing the settlements in the West Bank

And the British live in peace while the Arabs n Palestin and Jews have to suffer their earlier mistake
The British created this genocide by giving Jews land that didnt belong to them Why isnt anyone calling out the so called king and British prime minister to correct their mistake
I39m sorry but the word Israel appears I39m the Quran like eighty timesjudeha is the land of the Jews and older than the Muslim religion itself most phillastines which is what the are are Jordean Iraqi and Egyptian
What It doesnt only go back to 1900s facewithtearsofjoy  it goes back for almost 2000 years lol king Saul and king Solomonthe three who settled ancient gaza the banks and I sort of forgot the other settlement but this conflict goes back a few thousand years not just 1900s

I39m starting to get frustrated because of those people who make videos like israel vs palestine israel is where jesus came from and all you do is hate israel You dissapoint me
Why was the Yom Kipper war of 1973 left out of this brief history
I hate America
Now this is what I call real History clappinghandslightskintone  Nothing but Facts
So the Arabs were the first to attack Got it lol
England gave land that was never theirs
This is bias to the oppressors the Zionists cryingface  shame on you
In 1947 the Arab State was created when Palestine was divided into 2 states  When did the Arab State cease to exist
Even Aliens are amazed

Israel is bomming Palestine for no reason and also they want Palestinian land
Palestine does not exist and will never existredexclamationmark redexclamationmark redexclamationmark redexclamationmark 
I think its time for all the Christian countries to help Israel
In summary religion is poison
Civilian by day green bands by night Unmasking the truth in plain sight
Basically Palestine got greedy and tried to forcefully take more land and lost that battle In turn they ended up with less than what was given to them They keep it up and they wont have anything Dont start none wont be none I dont have a dog in this fight Im just stating what I observed in this video
I feel like the age of the arab conquest was perfect timing because we now all think egypt and israel etc  are native to the arabic people
It is not an IsraeliPalestinian conflict it39s instead an Israeli occupation of the Palestinian land
The accurate title  How the Israeli Occupation on Palestinian Began
It still doesn39t make sense brWhy are Muslims blowing them selfs up in jihad brIf all 3 religions want to worship a wall why fight eachother if we as a human race carnt decide on being peacefully with oneanother they all should leave that area Muslims should move away to mislim countrys Jewish should move to Israel and if they need more land to expand they should buy or make a deal with jordan christians need to move to Christian country39s then divide the year up so all religious can worship without any troublebrbrFrom my point of view if the christian  catholic countrys all have major weapons bombs ect jewish and muslims will all die in a genocidebrWe all seen what happened during ww2 everyone has witnessed the horrific events in iraq Germany we all know that kind of blood on your hands is the devils workbrbrYet Muslims and Jewish have been at it non stop from what i can see its pathetic
How do people think Palestine is in the right
A lot of facts are missing herecan39t claim that this is unbiased
Your history religious is incorrect in regards to the jews
Islam does not date back 4000 years it literally came out 1400 years ago making it a very recent religion
redheart 
So Palestine was Israel  land at that time
A few thousand years Blatentent wrong history implying islam is an ancient religion
So much lie in one small vidoe It was Palestinian land and US got to decide for them  US is big enough why didnt they give Jewish people some of their land Why Palestinian people had to give their land Israel is commuting a genocide right now 2024 They killed 15000kids and total of more than 30000 in last 4 months Tired of watching those bias history explanation Go follow bisan or motaz they are journalists who are currently reporting from Gaza Palestine
I am not surprised by this biased report fortunately nowadays the world can see through this bias brbrWhat happened to Palestinians is straight up Colonization
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvBno1m1zhIWsampt210330a you dont mention the 400 massacres comitted against the Palestinians
Some important details omitted 1948 partition plan was allocating 55 percent of the mostly fertile land to the Jewish MINORITY rather than negotiating down with the NATIVE population the deal only worsened
USA Britishers And Egyptians are the only Problem creaters in world
Palestine are bullies Israel are holy islam is the antichrist christianity is good isalm bad full stop
This is such a complex history with so much trauma to the people on both sides  It is a reminder that hate breeds more hate unfortunately I pray for peace and healing on both sides
So that39s the Palestinian Land no any IsraelbrRomans greeks and others lived here in the Western Balkans maybe they also have right on our slaws land  But no that is not even on their minds Why the west havent give the german land to jews they deserved that after the holocaust 
So much missing information
Israel is the 12 sons all black people
For anyone who thinks this video is somehow biased because of all the details they left out This video left out atrocities carried out by BOTH sides not just one Just because the video is not explicitly supporting your narrative doesnt mean its biased As neutral of a take as it gets
before Muslims there was Palestine ruled by Christians and Jewish arabs not the European invaders
Islam is always bad anyway
There are very very few people if any that are true JEWS When GOD separate the people GOD said he would NO LONGER BE WITH THE PEOPLE HE gave his word to the  CHRISTIANS AS THEY HAD READ AND ACCEPT JESUS AS THE MESSIAH IF YOU BOTHER TO READ THE BIBLE YOU WILL SEE THIS PLAIN AS DAY  AS FAR AS PALESTINE  THERE IS  AND NEVER HAS BEEN A PERSONAL GROUP OF PEOPLE The Palestinians are people  from all over the known world at that time there is NO SUCH PEOPLE The people who live there are from HAM so if you follow all the people from HAM  THEN YOU WILL KNOW WHY  and what is happing in ISAREL AND PALESTINE39
Jesus as died for the sins of the world accept him today God is coming again to Judge the earth in Christ Jesus lays all hope for siner Jesus saves the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand repent ye and believe the Gospel
Ask why have Jews been targeted through out life 
Imagine if it was some random land not considered quotholyquot Probably the borders would have been drawn and that would be the end of that

Both Jews and Muslims are advised to not eat pork and to eat clean food we have more similarities than we give ourselves credit for On The Contrary the state of Israel which is the government not the uninvolved people is not Israeli or Jewish for that matter they hide behind that name to hide what they really are which is zionists and are from the synagogue of satan Religious Orthodox Jews oppose the government and the state and politics just like their Religious Traditional Islamic Brethren
how can we be so sure that this is the accurate version of the history of the region Napoleeon Bonaprte once said what if history is a fable that we have all agreed upon with that being said it would be nice if jews and muslims could get along for once we are cousins if not brothers after all Prophet Abraham Pbuh had two sons Prophet Issac Pbuh and Prophet Ishmael Pbuh Jews descend from  Issac  and Arabs descend from  Ishamel

The God and prophet of Christianity  No bihh Jesus is God not a prophet
Did u mention Palestine back then was apart of uk territories
So many mistakes were made before during and after the Great War that we are still paying for today
In short it was more a prison escape than an attack It was like America back when they secluded the natives to reservations only in Israel they caged the population in and torment them so it was a matter of time
Great analysis Just a minor error at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0anQIEeLonAampt587947a where she said the PLO 39s negotiator was Mahmoud Abbas instead of Yasser Arafat

What about the Hebrew isrealites  black peoe6
They dont want to be beholden to Israel for their survival they want to be able to determine their own fate A fight we will all soon be having as states become more powerful and UBI becomes more common It has been the fight fought since time immemorial no one wants to be a slave Jews just happen to be the scapegoat for this since time immemorial but they suffer  the same fate
Sounds like no one wants to compromisecryingface 
The main problem now seems like the years of oppression of the Palestinians and the West Bank settlements
The story actually begins when Sarah whose husband was Abraham found she was barren and could not produce for him and heir  She told him to go to Hagar their servant to impregnate her and have a child to inherit his legacy  He did this  Then God said to Abraham Sarah is with child and she was and Abraham cast out Hagar and their child Ishmael

And yet Palestinians internal corruption and outside indifference continues without any change Why aren39t the Palestinians supported and assimilated by the other Arab nations who say they care so much about Palestinians so they can live decent lives Why don39t they help them build Gaza instead of weaponizing them as their tool of war against Israel Israel is a historically Jewish nation Why isn39t there a multicountry effort to oust Hamas and return the hostages so the attacks can cease I wish someone would make a video explaining the obvious questions we all have
A glaring error Egypt did not win back the Sinai after the 73 war It was only after negotiating a peace deal with Israel at The camp David accords Also I dont believe Syria was a party to those accords as stated here

Ezekiel 38 Its on
The israelian are not fascist Jews the Palestinians let them come into their and without straight out of the Holocaust after world War 2  To have  a peaceful place to live but the Israelites got greedy and colonize the country since 1947 and started wars with the cut them off and the chorus of about 7 years they killed many children and had wars with each Preston and had them in the open which were decent human beings for example any prison in the world or in the United States criminals have rights to be treated like human is an international and they also retaliate or fight for their human I do they get Justice to be treated fair So what39s the the fascist Jews had them locked up on the open air prison taking the freedom away from them or pressing them fighting wars with them and killing their children and innocent of course I39m going to fight back they39re not terrorist and they were held as an open prison except the big big difference they39re not criminals their innocent civilians in Hamas is fighting for Palestinian country The terrorists here are the fascist Israeli Jews They39re sick in their mind perverted psychopath And to top it off they39re just a bunch of thieves and murdering babies

Amazing nonbiased explanation of the conflict Thank you
Its not a good explanation at all It doesnt emphasis the important parts of the conflict Have you wonder for example why the arab state wasnt establish in 1948 Its because Jordan and Egypt didnt want Palestinian state Part of the reason because the Palestinian leader was a pro nazi
What have Muslim Islam Jihad nations etc done to bring Peace Joy Love Kindness and Mercy to their own peoplesbrThey have done nothing except shared a book that spreads hate corruption hypocrisy and murder wwbrThey cannot hide their bullying terrorist murdering treatment of their own peoples especially their women and those who have seen through the lies and corruption

You stole from palstine
This was a good description of the conflict Thanks for that
The most pressing issue is the status of Jerusalem I believe a potential solution lies in making Jerusalem the capital of both Israel and Palestine while explicitly excluding it from serving as the seat of government for either entity Both Israel and Palestine would have the autonomy to select their respective seats of government with the stipulation that Jerusalem cannot be chosen for either This arrangement is not unprecedented For instance in the Netherlands Amsterdam is the capital but The Hague is the seat of government
Follow the money you talked about the Balfour declaration but not about who it39s addressed to Lord Rothschild

Israel occupied palestine and formed israel It was wrong at the first place
Which country Germany was support
You didnt quite cover the history of the land You should start from 4000 years ago from the ancient kingdom of Israel to the invasion of roman empire to renaming Israel to palestine by the romans to the ottoman empire Jews never left the land Israel has never been zeroed with Jews to say that they no longer own the land bc more arab muslims are already there due to migration Put simply the Jews who were in exile simpy returned to the homeland They didnt occupy the land they returned to their land

Thank you
Cant even say israel correctly lmao
You have a very nuanced perspective for sure BUT I must say you shouldnt blame Palestine for waging war against Israel in 1948 This is because of the fact that the partition HEAVILY and UNFAIRLY favored Israel and gave away astronomically too much  land that rightfully belonged to Palestine The partition gave Israel the implied right to displace and kick out millions of Palestinians from their homes They had no choice but to fight back and wage war Really I think Palestines biggest mistake was electing hamas But its difficult to blame them fully when it seems like occupation and terror against their people will never end They are truly desperate
then let me give you an example imagine you are happily living in your house one day a stranger come to your house as of your kind heart you showed him hospitality but after somedays he met your father and requested for a space in your house and your father had just partitioned your room with him as un divided israel and palestine without liking your dads decission you started up fighting with him in order tp claim the area he had taken from you but he is also not in cooperation to give you back your land and day after day he slowly sfacewithopenmouth tarted stealing your things and because of this your mother had made peace treaty with him as pL made  but in the end ypur mind is not satisfied with it  and for many years you are suffering from the air attacks and land attacks made by him whenever you reach your fatherUN he the stranger just agree to him and within 2 393 days he continue what je was doing and day by day they are killing innocents in the name of killing terrorists just look at motaz azaizas videos for what israel is really doing on them  and one day you after the continuos disturbance from him you decided to fight against him with all the rage you had been holding in your mind and that was a special day to him and because of this the world stand against you and they forget what he had did to you in masjidul aqsa while you were praying for many decades he had even killed many of your people and after you took a decision the world started blaming you and a women sitting in a chair with bunch of expression packed gace is trying to twist the story in favour to israel how will you feel  from river to sea palestine will be free
anti indians only call india as bharat
You can39t compare israel palestine with india and Pakistanisrael occupied someone39s countrybut who were the ppl of india created a seperate nation and named as pakistan
Why are you calling india as BharatbrbrWhy don39t you keep your real name in youtube as quotSangi keerthi history quot
The video yu have posted abt israelis 935 is the video of wounded Palestinians
I personally think that because Palestine lost their land in a conflict they started themselves they have no right to come back and claim that land They39re victims of their own poor leadership and bad decisions
israel is still killin palastinien kids and women a child has been hung decapitated recently by israel
you missed a lot of part in between israel reallty did injustes to the palastiniens who welcomed them at the time of there hardship

I support Isreal but I respect Palestine  HATE PALESTINE 50   RESPECT PALASTINE 50  
Okay sure i see thousands of comments respecting israel Okay respect a country that destroyed hospitals in Gaza and killed 30 THOUSAND people in Gaza with so much of them being children and babied with the average age of 5 years old I get that the hamas bombed Israel before because Palestine wanted a country But Israel went too far by killing too many people in Gaza Israel didnt even leave the poor KIDS and literal BABIES alone Most of the people that were killed arent even part of the hamas which just proves to show that what Israel is doing is bad People in Gaza barely have any food and have nowhere to live How about the people in Israel I get some of them didnt kill the people in Gaza but theyre laughing about all the dead children
While this explains a lot it has some inaccuraciesbr1 The British won WWII and they didnt let go of Palestine until 1947br2 The mission of the UN is to promote peace so the fighting was likely on accidentbrStill great video

israel can turn onoff water electricity and internet of gaza if this is not occupation what is occupation 
Palestine right
I dont understand why a piece of land is always so precious than human lifes
full support for israel
israel for sure is right
The terminology used in this video is clearly biased for Israel this is not balanced at all Zionists came to the land and illegally occupied Palestine and killed and drove people out of their own land and homes this was the start of this war simple as that
They could have peacefully coexisted but the greed for more ruined it all I understand the sentiments behind winning the whole country backbut even historically what you loose in a war sadly you loose You will still be agitated correct but the decision of whether you will think about the wellbeing of your people or fight till the last man alive kind of mentality is solely yours to decide Once you take that decision and take actions accordinglyit completely becomes your responsibilitythe consequences you must have calculated beforehand and yet took that step willingly A warboth sides looses but at the end the one who made the call for that 67 oct attack has the blood of thousands on his hand and more and that can39t be denied Partially people are also responsible as you can39t expect good governance from a terrorist outfit especially when you had a better option at hand
Yeah its not like Judea was there first 2000 years ago or anything
Illegally taking land anywhere in the world USA being the prime example will lead to war and the Jews have to go back and give the land back to the Palestinians so the blood shed can stop otherwise they will simmer in their own soup
Unbelievable
so in Short Israel has been Invading Palestine since the 1800s and the tension stems from Arabs trying to keep their territory
The demographics and how the land is Abraham is from a land which is Iraq and settled in Palestine which is Israel which means he was brown skinned because tht whole country is a desert hot and dry until the British came and do what they do best colonize and mix created the Jews we know now Thts pale no offense and they leave to Europe mix even more come back even more European in the 1800s if you look at the map and the land everyone around there is browned skinned and either African or Arab or mixed with those two because East African ppl started mixing with them around this time Thts y they look alike anyways my point is PalestineIsrael was an originally black and brown place before the British took over
I love how this immediately starts off with them showing pretty much the recent map without Israel even though Britain was ruling it
Evil called Israel
The end is near
You said quotlaunched an attackquot as if they tried to attack the nation of israel and not murder 1500 innocent civillians
You said quotlaunched an attackquot as if they tried to attack the nation of israel and not murder 1500 innocent civillians
Jews have lived on the land of Israel continuously for almost 4000 years The land of Israel is the birthplace of the Jewish people
This video is severely misleading No more than 600000 Palestinians left Israel and more than 68 percent of them left before they even saw any Jewish soldiers On top of that they were told by the Arab leaders to go ahead and leave for a few daysweeks while they through the Jews in to the sea Palestines map also did not look like Israels today The ottomans map was called a sanjak map which outlined the Palestinian land as a small area near the sea So the land offered to Palestinians by the UN was more than what they had  On top of that the land patrician given to the Jews was one that had already been purchased by the Jews in the desertswamp land The Jews drained the swamp and brought water to the desert and then everybody wanted their land Stop re writing history
I hope everyone sees this video

A Brief History of the name Palestine and its derivative Adjective Palestinianbrbr 1	Palestine is Judea the Roman name for Land of the Jews when the Roman Emperor Hadrian renamed this land as Palestina in 135 CE Since then it was never an Islamic State In the 2nd century CE the Romans crushed the Jewish revolt and Judea was renamed Syria Palestina  Jewish Virtual Librbrbr2	The PreIslamic Arabs were in the Roman armies and witnessed both Jerusalems destruction and the name change of Judea Flavius Josephus Wars Book V Ch 13 4 As well the Quran mentions Israel as the land of the Jews Thereby the Muslim people would be fully aware Palestine referred to the Jews for 2000 yearsbrbr3	The historical archives of the Persians Greeks Romans British French and Americans refer to Palestine as the historical homeland of the Jews not of the Muslim peoples Americas early Presidents initiated Israels return prior to Britain and Herzl Restoring the Jews to their national home in Palestine is a noble dream My emancipated hope is the restoring of the Jews to their nation home in Palestine  President Abraham Lincoln to Canadian Zionist Wentworth Monk 1863 brbr4	The term Palestine was introduced in the Hebrew Bible from the term Plishtim Invaders The Muslims disdained the name Palestine as they do the term Zionists today In 1947 the Arabs virtually begged of Britain not to use this name for the land Thereby the usurping of this name in the 1960s is not credible as a mark of land ownership because it was not one of historical usage by the Arabs brbr5	 A host of Islamic scholars and historians decried and rejected Muslims as Palestinians Allah Gave the Land of Israel to the Jews The alAqsa Mosque was built on top of Solomons Temple  Eleventh century historian Muhammad Ibn Ahmad alMaqdisi and fourteenth century Iranian religious scholar Hamdallah alMustawfi  There is no such thing as Palestine in history absolutely not  ArabAmerican historian and Princeton University Professor Philip Hitti testifying before the AngloAmerican Committee in 1946 brbr6	A host of Jewish organizations and Institutions were called by the prefix of Palestine or Palestinian in the 20th century including The Jewish Palestine Brigade in Britains WW2 Military Forces The Jewish Palestine Symphony Orchestra Todays Jerusalem Post media was called The Palestine Post brbr7	 There are no Arab Muslim Palestinians on record prior to the 20th century the land was referred only as the homeland of the Jews It is validated by a host of archives by many nations and some one million Archaeological relics Thereby the nativity claim can only apply to Jews In fact there was never a time of no Jews in Palestine the past 2000 years as evidenced by the Crusaders Islamic invasions and the previous Ottomans brbr8	Generally real natives do not usurp the name of other natives especially one they disdained There is a propaganda war going on now with regard to the term Palestine It is specifically employed to avoid the use of the name Israel and must be considered an antiIsrael term  Dr Thomas McCall the Senior Theologian of Levitt Ministry quoting Zola Levitt brbr9	 The previous Islamic Ottoman rulers of Arabia declared Palestine as the homeland of the Jews  Who can challenge the rights of the Jews in Palestine Good Lord historically it is really your country  Ottoman Mayor and scholar Yusuf Diya alKhalidi Jerusalem 1899 brbr10	 Judeas original previous name was Israel in 1002 BCE established under King David and again in 1947 when this country was reestablished by the UN Israel is mentioned in the Quran as one belonging to the Jews Joshua J Mark  Ancient History Encyl brbr11	 All Religious Scriptures acknowledge Palestine as the Land of Israel Land of Judea and

Dont take j3ws at any circumstances especially european and Americans it will be your fate but in the last they will go no one accept them in the middle east after what they have done

This was very biased and inconsistent
If I were an Israeli citizen watching this Id feel guilty and just move elsewhere  But no most of them wanna double down on genocide and you hurt there feelings if arent 100 on there side
Ancient Isreal kingdom was established in Canaanites territory after killing the Canaanites and stealing their land while Israelites originally came from Ur BabylonIraq Interestingly neoZionism established modern Isreal state while killing the Palestinians and stealing Palestinian land brPalestinians are the descendants of those Canaanites mixed with Minoans and other Levantines and Semitic origins and are the legitimate indigenous inhabitants

A very brief and misleading history of the Jewish Palestinian conflict
maybe its better to ask why all the Muslims countries around didn39t want to gat people from gaza brmaybe its better to ask where is the country of the Jewish people if not Israel
So many errors in this video the State of Palestine never existed It was an Ottoman territory conquered by the british
This is a very biased take
Its literally like a cancer
Fax
There is a lot of history missing here
Its wrong report
So you start telling the story after 1900 and claim you hold the truth Really And people that watch this video are quotawankenedquot to the truth How about reading about the conflict historically in the bronze age iron age this belonged to the jews
We need a comprehensive boots on the ground documentary on the actual illegal settlements in West Bank and what Gaza looks like today
lmao bro why are you guys watching a turkish news channel
So there39s absolutely no history before 1946
This map has been thoroughly debunked multiple times  Strange how the Turkish public broadcast service doesn39t seem to care
Why religion is bad
Why is this quotimproper for some audiencesquot
This is very misleading first off you start from the near history instead of starting a few thousand years agobrHamas is not a political group it is a terror organization terrorizing everyone in the area Israelis and Palestinians alikebrIsrael does not attack without a reason never ever you state that the Israeli attacks continued but you left out the why they continued because Palestinians were attacking innocent Israeli civilians so Israel had to defend itselfbrAt the end you state that Israel should establish peace in the area well we have tried multiple times in the past 70 years with no success because Palestinians never held their side of the peace agreements that they signed on they just broke the peace agreements whenever they had enough ammunition to kill as many Israelis as possiblebrSo please do check your half facts because you are only showing a one sided story and demonizing Israel if you bring all of the facts into account than you could call this video history because for now its just some random facts that happened in history and not the true history of the areabrbrYou should ask these two simple questionsbr1 What will happen if israel stops attacking palestiniansbr2 What will happen if palestinians stops attacking israelisbrbrWell I will help you out the first answer is that the Palestinians will kill most jews in Israel and take over the landbrThe second answer is we will have peace here as Israel never strikes first as implied by its army name Israel DEFENCE forcesbrbrGood Day
So who startted it
Why did youtube say this is inappropriate Wtf
Lesson learned dont let the British draw borders
You left out many many things  didn39t you  Do you think all people are ignorant and unintelligent  I39m sure it39s frustrating for you and your organization that everyone is not so stupid  Ave that your propaganda is only effective to ignorant unintelligent moronsbrbrOrganizations and people like you do a disservice to the world by attempting to spread this garbage You and your friends are evil
This is fake news
I suggest that whoever made this looks up the meaning of quotobjective amp truthful reportingquot I guess this is the kind of BS all the western morons who attend quotfree Palestinequot protests get their info from
You lost me at Zionist movement Why does such BS keep getting passed on in new videos when simple research could disproves nonsense

Isreal was created before Christ was born Even if you dont believe in religion it was well documented The Ottoman Empire stole the land during rule and Isreal took it back once the empire fell with the help of Britain Because isreal and britain both had a sense of democracy Jerusalem for instance was never part of Palestine Like seriously are people that uneducated Thats just one lie in many You need to go waaaaayyy further back to be educated
As someone who knows history well This is factually flawed This is nothing more than a propaganda video and both paties deserve a better detailed explanation You can39t explain a conflict that has gone on this long in a 5 minute video Every point you made about the UN and the wars and the PLO and Hamas and the IDF and agreements made in the past need to be explained in detail or else its just gaslighting Sorry I feel bad for everyone involved But this video is just a bunch of bs and both Isreal and Palestine deserve better Two thumbs down for this video Its for the unintelligent
Long Live Israel Israel 
Clearly this is a broadcast organization that is Turkish and in opposition to anything Israeli or isn39t Muslim
Completely laughable you think that this is Real history

Why dont you guys go before this date you always start  at 1946
This video in my comment shows Hamas crimes
Isreal declared war on Hamas NOT Palestinians  You are part of the problem not the solution Israelis are good  Hamas is evil Wake TF up
You took the idea of brief very seriously and left out many important thingsfacewithtearsofjoy 
This video is so biasedbr Some important questions needs to be asked brwhy the so called Palestinians didnt establish a Palestinian country until the jews decided to establish israel They only remembered they want a country when the jews wanted a country in this region What a coincidence right brWhy they defined themselves as Arabs and not Palestinian until the idea of israel came up brAnd where is the name Palestine   came from How is this term ties to the arabs of this region There were also jews living in this region why only arabs call themselves PalestinianbrHow can jews be invaders and occupiers if they lived in this land as well brAnd for this to be an occupation theres need to be a country before but there was not a country it was only a region under many foreign controls throughout historybrbrSo basically this video is a bunch of biased nonsense Stop trying to change history because it fits your narrativebrHistory is factual things that happened not your opinion of what happened
Talk about a totally one sided view  What a load of nonsense this is
J
Read the history boos this is all untrue
what a bunch of lies from the beginning In 1946 there was NO Palestine it was called Palestine by the British mandate   a territory that was controlled by the British empire In 1947 the UN decided the partition plan  to divide the land to jews and arabs you must understand that in 1946 during the British rule all the inhabitants were called Palestinians by the Brits  both Jews and Arabs brLearn some History instead of propagating lies
From the river to the sea Palestine will be free
Western media are blind about this

trtworld Is there any way we could translate this video to German so more people can learn the real history of the state
you know something is wrong when the very first slide shows Jordan as a country in 1946 LMAO
Palestine was never a country to begin with It39s just a ppl They claim to be from that area but never was there a complete country formed named Palestine the only country that got formed was Isreal
The first line itself is wrongthe only Palestine that existed in 1946 was the British Mandate of Palestine not a country called Palestine There was never a country or geopolitical entity called Palestine just a geographic region controlled by the Mamluks Ottomans and then the British before 1948
This is not a  conflict this is occupation

Well this is a distorted and biased take now isnt it   Or a fan of facts and history are we
The initial maps don39t make any sense You appear to be mixing up areas where there are precise settlements with areas of general political geography ie  Apples with oranges I find it difficult to believe the rest of the video if you are attempting to distort facts in the first few video frames
The Crusaders coming from Europe occupied our land in Palestine for 300 years  in the Middle  and they fought Eastern Christianity and accused them of being heretics and committed brutal killing against them and Muslims and despite the long period of occupations the insistence of our ancestors on regaining their land remained and this is what is happening now  Palestine For its people and it will only be for its people and whoever wants to live with us in peace we have no problem provided that he abandons his colonial ideas
Why not show a map before 1946 Like when Jews inhabited the land before anyone else
you make a lot of good points but you fail to tell the truth
quotWe never took land from the Palestiniansquot People currently taking land from the Palestinians
This video is pretty bias
You forgot to mention Palestine was the name the Roman Empire gave to the land Palestinians were everyone who lived there including Jews So saying the Jews kicked Palestinians out is a complete distortion of history Moreover the history began far before the Roman Empire existed meaning before the invention of the word Palestine and archaeological evidence say that there was a majority of Jews living on the land that was referred as The Land of IsraelbrbrIn essence this video is a twisted interpretation of history and I suggest those who claim otherwise to look for evidence from reputable unbiased sources online
False facewithtearsofjoy facewithtearsofjoy facewithtearsofjoy 
So are you saying Israel displaced all those people in a day Because the 5 Arab nations invaded and attacked Israel the very next day after they rejected the 2 state solution And why start at the Ottoman Empire Why not explain why the Jews were in Europe to begin with and where they originated from
Why this channel doesn39t explain that Israel bombing Gaza after those terrorists attacked and launched thousands of rockets to Israel
Youtube required me to sign in saying this video was not appropriate for some ages Seems like they are trying to pevent this video from reaching and educating more people
maybe stop constantly waging war and actually accept peace deals aye

Israel says it has been  quotaggressively patroling Rafah quot  but infact it  has been indescriminately bombing civilians homes  in Rafah  deceasing many civilians sheltering there after  they had moved from other areas  to this supposed safe area 
The IDF themselves in thier field operations used many former schools    Unwra and UN buildings for thier troop  positions and firing points
Claims about UNWRA and hamas developing from within UNWRA its self  are fake news propaganda brbrThere is no independent evidence that  these claims are true or even partially true   merely hear say propagated by the Israel regime and the IDF 
Claims about Hamas  using  schools   the UN  building and UNWRA buildings whilst in use for thier intended purposes are incorrect  and fake news    They are only using the now long empty buildings previously  used by these organsiations  but long since abandoned as IDF bombing and shelling in the area rendered them  unsafe for staff and the organisations evacuated from them completely

Israelis Jewish people lived in Gaza since the 10th century BCE around the time of King David The Palestinians have no legitimate claims to Gaza This  has been an abracadabra paradigm since around 2005   At that point Israelis were  quotexpelledquot from the area after terrorists proxies of Iran went about murdering Israelis but still demanded free  fresh water free electricity and  free plumbing paid for by Israel  because Hamas did not believe in Palestinian infrastructure building

Saudi Arabia brings Americans to Middle East thats is the end of peace  in Middle East
The path to peace is actually not easy You see the tunnels built shows insurrection It is an idea copied from the vietnamese during the vietnam war which the people of vietnam won against the americans It shows that they spent vast amounts of money trying to reclaim Gaza covertly However no one knows how they could have done that without everyone in Gaza having some knowledge of it Did Israel know Did they help build those tunnels I actually think the tunnels are a symbol of defiance but the problem is now that they have been discovered they will have to be destroyed because the question remains who supplied millions of dollars to build these vast networks I am totally against going after poor people who are defenceless regardless of how quotungratefulquot they are but politics agendasdogmasextremeviews is usually evil like that What is happening in Gaza is an example of what happens to poor people everyday around the world The attack may not be as obvious but they are just as much made a mockery of by the souless If I say now the Jews have contributed alot to the world I would be shut down by pro palestinian supporters who will ask me how is genocide a positive contribution to the world I would then have to delete my comment in fear of retaliation when all I was doing is trying to tell people this is why they enjoy alot of support in the world today My maternal grandfather survived WW2 and he once told me it is better being mistaken for a Muslim than a Jew and I think that is precisely why Europe drove them out but not muslims So today when we look at Gaza we must look back at WW2 and ask ourselves why they needed to drive them out of europe through genocide I think what happened to the Jews during WW2 should never be repeated again because it was sick and wrong to do that to anyone yet today we hear of common people all over the world still being used as guinea pigs without their consent for various experiments social or otherwise

Wrong Decades ago after the 2nd war Colonial Britain washed its hands of Palestine deals were done with the UN and the jews The jews moved in and systematically started stealing land by force and killing the Palestinian people Self written laws granting them legal theft in thier own eyes Similar laws like the ICJ ruled on against them that they now dont recognise October 7th was a retaliation for decades of occupation and cruelty It was not an attackI was a defensive action Put the timeline in its context and see who did wrong to who first Thus it is not aggression but defence Hammas initiated
Sir Palestinians are Muslim wo kabhi Galat galti se bhi nhi soch sakte kisiko aap show bulalete hai thik nhi hai sir
It started way before 1948 it started in Bible times when jews settled the land in place of the evil Canaanites and before you say I got my education from a toilet there is proof that cannanites engaged in child sacrifice and ritual prostitution and Muslims didn39t settle the land until the 600s when the Islamic empire took over the place so it39s safe to say that jews settled the place first therefore they should get the land plus Sinai however this does not justify Israels horrific crimes against Muslims

Wrong Israel responded by killing people from hamas not Palestinians in gaza
They want the colonial war terrosits to leave  them and their land alone and return to europe and other countries they came from Its juat as simple as that
Crazy how killing hundreds in Gaza turned into killing 30000
Dont feel symphaty for the people who can not live together in peace you are wasting your time and energy
   
To those people who supports palastine only and particularly to those Muslims who says palastine is right in the name of allaah just answer this damn question wht was hamas thinking of how Israelis respond if u r not powerful enough to protect ur country then don39t go attacking other powerful entities and also if u go back in time you39ll find that many countries conquering it and capturing it well British was ruling so they took their decision there39s nothing israel or palastine could do hamas is a terrorist organisation who even kill their civilians itself do some research about their brutality on their civilians itself so to those many ppl still defending wht if we Indians start attacking Pakistan saying that its our land  and was just only given by British talking about past which was not in ur control is foolishness And another question wbt the jews who had to flee everywhere they go before supporting palastine do some research
Israel Israel Israel Israel 
It doesnt matter who you support in the war but I think everyone can agree that the innocent civilians and children being killed on both sides is completely unacceptable I hope that this conflict can come to an end in the most peaceful matter possible
I refuse to allow differing opinions about Biden and Trump or this IsraeliPalestinian war ruin my relationships with my adult children
How do we know whose telling the truth
i believe that we as a human being have such a smart and clever mind so that we cant convince with a wrong informatios though every one around as trust on the false one therefore please search of the real story of Palastine and be honest because you are responsible about your ideas this is not just for this channel this is for every one of you guys
You dont know anything so dont just assume you cant tell us what hamas wants your just giving your own opinion they want their hostages back and have been trading coaches full of Muslim hostages which you dont know about for just a few israleis who were let well and fed and looked after

brDON39T LET ANYONE CONVINCE YOU THAT IT STARTED ON OCTOBER 7TH
I39m sorry but this short few min explanation  is not satisfactory The land belonged to Palestinians and was taken over by the majority Jewish people The land should not have been given to the Jews by uk as it was never there39s Fa39s food Palestinians  have been kicked out the the racist zionist state and Palestinians  Just want to return and have their land back The Palestinians  are being oppressed  by Israelis
That is Israel39s land since the Bible days All that happened inbetween cannot undo that
I love how you dodged mentioning that Israel invaded Palestine in 1948 under the green lights of the civilized west brbrWell Palestine has always existed Whether you accept it or not The olive trees are witnesses on the long history of Palestine and the Palestinian culture
Sounds like Germany and maybe Britain needs to clean up the mess they made
im sorry i think u got a point wrong israel killed more than 10000 people in gaza not just a 100 and there are more under the rubble we have a side who treats hostages like human beings and the other side that is bombing civilians that include women and children
I dont get why jewish is doing this when they lived threw it
You need to check the British census figures for the 194039s The number of Jews Arabs and others
One day they39re dressed in 39civilian clothes39 and the next day we know what they are wearing
This report is historically wrongbrThe Palestinians had their own state as palestine way before the resolution in 1947brIts even stated in Balfours declaration to establish a homeland for the jewish people in PALESTINE in 1917brPalestine was a state in which muslims and christians and even jews lived in harmony before the idea of zionism that wanted this land since 1890  50 years before the holocaust
Israel seems to be really good at getting people to support HamasbrAfter seeing Israel39s war crimes the crimes of Hamas look like tiny papercuts in comparison
One if Ten Commandments brThou shall not kill brbrThese religion folks killing each other lol err  they both already lost and dont even know at this point theyre just playing around with their artillery like toys

well as long as they are good muslims they will  surely win   jews  will never win a war against any1 they will b sufferin39 till the judgement day coz they killed prophets  and blv they are superior than  other humans even  than   God himself thats why God said that they will never have a quot homequot  read Coran amp u39ll understand all whats happening in our era
Pride is the devil
122 days and Israel is listening only to Israel and stopping for nobody thats the reality
A few questions
brWho agreed the Jews establish a state on the border of Palestine
brWho sailed the Jews to this land
brHas they ever asked the people living on this land if they agree or not
brSo unfair
brAsking Pakistan not to retaliate and maintain socalled kindness
brWithout experiencing hardships oneself one should not advise others to do good
Hamas killed thousands not hundreds
It goes back way further than the 1940s go do some research and stop manipulating people to fit your narrative
You mean Israel has responded by killing TENS of THOUSANDS of people in gaza
Are you seriosuly mixing truth with lies together That39s just deception
brYes israel had the germany problems so they had to find a new home that was bpalestineb who were fine with it but israel later betrayed them more and more that israel now almost fully owns palestine bPalestine defends themselves for the first timeb and boom They39re the bad people great job humanity Just a sad world we live in and praying for the innocent people in general

PAlestine is a refuge for terrorists gorups and Islam  it always has been the bible predicts this stuff it says Israel as a nation shell fall and never rise again and it willwith peopel nowadays everyone is pro palestine not knowing the history of these 2 countries and the constant fighting in the end it says the Lord will come and fight with his peopelso i have to side wiht the Jay Ceehes the saviourif he fights for Israel i must also hes my saviour and redeemer Praise JEsus GLory to Ukraine and israel

Oh you seem to have forgotten to include why the war actually started on October 7th when hamas invaded Israel and slaughtered 1400 jew the biggest killing of jews since the holocaust
I think hamas did war crimes and hid in populated areas which made israel kill a couple of civillians by accident we never wanted to kill anybody its hamas
Exactly why I get so sick of hearing Free Palestine Neither side is right yet all these people in the western world want to pick sides This isnt your fight these arent your people nobody deserves praise

Most biased news piece Ive seen in my life
Roman Emperor Hadrian decided to punish the Jews by changing the name of the province from quotJudeaquot to quotPalestinequotbrFor the Romans the name quotPalestinequot had nothing to do with modernday Palestinians who of course did not even remotely exist at the time The Romans knew the coastal region of the Land of Israel as quotPalestinequot which was named after the ancient Philistine people who once inhabited the coastal territory of the Land of Israelbr The Philistines disappeared from the history books when the Assyrians conquered and exiled them some 700 years before the Roman periodbrA 2019 DNA study of skeletons exhumed from Philistine tombs in the coastal Israeli cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon found that the Philistines come from a quotsouthern European gene poolquot In other words the ancient Philistines have no genetic relation whatsoever to the modern PalestinianArabs
No one cares what Palestine and hamas wants they should have thought about this before now its toooooooo late Its definitely sad that citizens occasionally get caught in the middle but this should have been thought about Israel will never allow this to happen again USA stands with Israel forever
Jews are the indiguos of the land jews originally came from Judea which is israel of today Jews were sitting on this land for over 3000 years and came back to their land Arab has 23 countries Jews own their only tiny country that is the same size as new jearsy Palestinians that was in the area of israrl are job seakers work immigrants that came to Israel area from Arab countries slowly slowly from the 19 century Stop re write history and tell only bits of the history for biased nerative 
Good documentary now why are all the Palestinians in the UK screaming at us and our politicians
This sounds like a hidden agenda type of situation from the British side Another bad situation due to greed
Opinions formed on the genocide is honestly just if someone is thinking of the past or the present

Explains alot and been searching history and as a Lebanese i learnt that they are born to be taught evil to us brIdc what side yall on but dont deny the fact that Israel is evil They even celebrated the 911 attack they were dancing while the people lost their beloved relatives and siblings and family The police caught them and there were reports of a saying that Jews were behind all yet they blame it on Arabs Such a shame
Iarael Palestine and Hamas explained in ten seconds for Americans  One side is lying  The other side is also lying  Stay out of it it39s not our business
Why should I support either side  Maybe they should be adults and figure out their own problems  Once they are both gone we wont have to hear about them 
2 minutes is not long enough to explain 100 years Good try though
The holocaust was done by the west and here innocent Palestinians are paying the price with their lives If West and Britain wanted to make Israel so bad they should have given their land to jews why they took Palestinian land and give it to jews without the consent of Palestinians THE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS ARE NOW THE OPPRESSORS
Not gona lie had to watch this 5 or 6 times to grasp it all
Hamas are basically Nazis
Even in the US who has sided with Israel I understand that theres two sides to every story and we are being shown Hamas everyday is not an accurate reflection of the truth of Palestinians
Why are so many Americans standing for Palestine Sounds like hamas threw the first rocket Please educate me
My question is why are we picking up at 1946 instead of the actual beginning
Please do not get your news from the news
Simple Answer Hamas wants people to die
Well they tried to help the jews and looked what happened both are wrong and both end lifes Two wrongs dont make a right
So if you dont believe in their religion you should die
Imagine a thief and criminal broke into a house and managed to evict the family and killed some of its members to give the house to a European gang  How would the court in the UK deal with this case  If you were the judge how would you deal with it honestly

Isra39 and Mi39raj are thought to have happened before the Hijrah 622 CE while there is no evidence of a masjidmosque in terms of a structure in Jerusalem until after Caliph Umar arrived to build one sixteen years later 638 CE

THIS IS ISLAMIC STATE RUN TV no wonder its so whacked
See here they don39t want to share with anyone else They want control of it all and to subjugate everyone and even in this story she states that it is the holiest place of the Jews  it belongs to the Jewsthe Masque was built way later as an insult
There are 8 entrances only  not anyone else
You believe that Muhammad flew around on a magic horse  Seriously and the al aqsa Masque is off limits to Jews
Yes things did get heated and security increased after the second intifada  which was a series of attacks on Israeli civilians by Hamas and Islamic jihadists  including stabbings suicide bombings blowing up buses attacks on cafes  car rammings the Passover massacre and on and on
they pushed the envelope right into oct 7th
thank you Romans and Babylonians
Three holy sights  Islam  Christian and Judaism  Religion mixed with political power has caused violence and instability Today  maybe Israel and Palestine could live two independent states but with when it comes to rights of aqsa compoundetc this will be a fight until the end of the world Shame people do not understand how a volcano erupts due underground instability  temperature changes geological changes  volcan always erupts so often Until the deep roots of of christianity islamic and judaism ideology target the true peace in terms of political religion and power sharing  it is a total loss even with United nations and other world organisations A common goal is achieved when different  group people view the lens from the same angle

The Temple Mount has NOTHING to do with the false prophet mohmmed or the fake god allah or the false religion of islam and all anti Israel protesters are ignorant and do not know what they stand for There is NO nation called palistine and never has been and Israel owns Gaza and Israel is fighting a terrorist group who attacked them called hamas which puts the people living in Gaza in harms way by using them as human shields in hospitals etc while they attack the peaceful nation of Israel for no reason except that they hate Jewish people and God This is a SPIRITUAL WAR Satan hates God so Satan and his people will always attack Israel and the Jewish people and God because Israel is the nation that God created through which to give the world our Savior Jesus Christ Israel is the nation through which God revealed Himself to the fallen pagan world to as the ONE True Living God of all of creationbrbrSatan and his people will also always fight over Jerusalem and the Temple Mount because Jerusalem is the city that God chose to represent heaven on earth the Holy Bible tells us that the eternal heaven is called the quotNew Jerusalemquot The Temple mount has NOTHING to do with the false prophet mohammed or with the fake god allah or with the false religion of islam all false religions and fake gods come from Satan Satan and his people will also always attack Christians because true born again Christians are God39s true church on earth and they follow Jesus Christ and they have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and SaviorbrbrWe must remember that this is our temporary home separated from God for a short period of time because of sin but all people who believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the Holy Bible and accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior by believing that Jesus was God on earth Who died to pay for our sins for us and resurrected from the dead to defeat eternal death for us and believe that Jesus is coming back again to set up His eternal kingdom will be forgiven of their sins and have eternal life reconciled with GodbrbrRead the entire Gospel of Jesus Christ in the Holy Bible in Matthew Mark Luke and JohnbrbrTHE GOSPEL THE GOOD NEWS OF JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD AND SAVIOR brbrJesus Christ came down here from heaven God on earth to be born one of us His own creation and He dwelt among us for over three decades and He taught us about God and His eternal heavenly kingdom and how to live righteously and He lived a perfect sinless life Then He gave His sinless life to all people from all nations to pay for our sins for us by dying on cross and resurrecting from the dead three days later to take the punishment for our sins for us to defeat eternal death for us to reconcile us sinners with God to give us eternal life with Him and after He resurrected from the dead to defeat death for us He lived on earth for forty more days speaking with many people then He ascended back up into heaven and He is coming back again at the end of this world to set up His eternal heavenly kingdom for all people who believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the Holy Bible and accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior to live in for the rest of eternity forgiven of their sins and reconciled with God

Im so very tired of the two medieval approaches that are being taken toward one another in IsraelPalestine   Theocracy and the use of religion as a guide to governance is outdated limits human liberty in service to matters of conscience i Ways it shouldnt and only creates friction between groups who cling to their backward customs more dearly than they do their lives The region needs to enter the 21st century relinquish all the religious and ethnic hatred and have one unified modern secular democratic state defined by equality for all and privilege for none  The Israeli government needs to abandon theocracy and inequality and the Palestinians need to have the 1967 borders restored all illegal settlements vacated and to receive compensation for all their land seized by force since 1948
Nice propaganda Well doneclappinghands 
try telling the truth   One the city was only divided in 48 because Jordan land grab that was never recognized    Two Jordan has failed to prevent damage to mount and attacks from the mount   Rocks have rained down on people below    If the mount is holy to the Muslim than why have they ripped up paving stones to throw off the mount   Why has Jordan leaders done an said nothing about weapon being secreted into the mosque     The agreement in 67 was meant to make peace and yet Jordan and the Palestinians have used it as a club and fake causes to keep the war going on
I pray peace between the two countries
This is SO biased But see whose video this is And this was all built on top of a holy Jewish site
I hate Ben Gvir but on this he is not wrong Not allowing Jews to visit THEIR HISTORIC temple mount is not only racist but absurd on its face If its holy for all 3 religions then all 3 religions should be allowed to visit Muslim supremacy is not cool
Islam can have 3 holy sites but Judaism can39t even have 1brThis report supports that Jews are the earliest and original owners of the compound and the mosque only came in to being after the Romans destroyed the Jewish temple amd forced many of the Jews into exile into Europe leaving their HomelandbrbrIn my opinion Palestine are tenants Tenants who occupied the area because the original landlords were chased away by a bigger military powerbrbrbrBefore you come to criticize this view ask your self these questions  if the Romans had not destroyed the Jewish temple and forced jews into exile would the Al aqsa mosque have been built there regardless of if the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven from that spotbrIf the Jews were not displaced from their homeland at first would it have been easy or even possible for the prophet Muhammad to have Journeyed to that spot in order to ascend to heavenbrbrGive the Jews back their landsbrThese people have been persecuted enough already

Beduins have nothing to do in Jerusalem Their presence is due to a false dream by Qathem abd al Lat in 622 who thought he was carried on a flying mule But the place was built only in 637 brYHVH39s temple shall be rebuilt whatever it costs
From an outsider perspective it seems like limiting prayer at the site to Muslim prayer is very selfish and for Israeli government officials like BenGvir to act with defiance and disrespect is arrogant It should probably just be open to everyone to pray visit and treat with respect
Jews deserve a country
Americans British Germans and French are unanimous in maintaining the occupation of Palestine For this they arm finance and supply their ally Israel while turning a blind eye to the genocides perpetrated in the land of Palestine These countries are openly the sworn enemies of Arab nation made up of Arab peoples who are also kept in a state of slavery by dictatorial regimes supported by these imperialist countries which are at the origin of all the misfortunes of the world These countries which hold economic power and military power are for the moment invincible and no one can stop them from defending crimes committed by Zionists But a glimmer of hope has been lit by the mobilization of people of the West who have finally understood what39s going on behind them by their fascist leaders who are imposed on them by the international Zionist cartel

To the question How much do you support the military operation carried out by the Palestinian resistance led by Hamas on October 7th 593 per cent supported it strongly with another 157 per cent of people supporting it somewhat  a combined total of 75 per cent backing the slaughter of men women and children
br
brThe Oct 7 attacks are widely attributed to Hamas but more specifically it is likely that it was Hamass military wing the Qassam Brigades that carried out the raid
br
brAnd how do Palestinians view the Qassam Brigades The poll found that 791 per cent of Gazans had a positive view of the organization and in the West Bank that grew to 954 per cent As for Hamas almost 60 per cent of Gazans had a positive view of it with that number rocketing to 877 per cent in the West Bank
br
brIslamic Jihad which like Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization in Canada is supported by 719 per cent of Gazans and over 90 per cent of people in the West Bank And to finish the role call of terror groups the AlAqsa Martyrs Brigades is viewed positively by almost 70 per cent of Gazans and over 80 per cent of West Bank respondents

bit biast of a of a take if i do say so myself not that I39m very un biast myself but personally i belive it has everything with the information i have with the situation cause like the idea that jews don39t worship at the mount because a rabbi in 1967 said its too holy is just silly Itamar BenGvir is somewhat correct that it is discriminitory against them the rule does not exist cause its to holy or to close to the dead its cause they don39t want to provoke conflict the proof for this is that now jews do pray there in quotsecretquot and in the past they could be killed for just praying at the wall also bit of a richard move to build a temple on top of the previous jewish temple

You are a very brave character
And to think this was years ago now we are witnessing Israel committing Genocide against Palestine and they did crush Gaza This was all planned
boring
Why are you guys so silent this time around
quot When you have this much power what is your responsibilityquot Prescient words Free Palestine
He explained the solution of this history of conflict
The person is very concious brHe is what he brought the truth

I would LOVE to find a way to be in touch with Trevor Noah  I created three PPTsa discussion for my community here in the Massachusetts with the title quotAntisemitism is at the heart of white nationalismquot  In the 2nd one I dedicated four slides to Trevor Noah39s book Born a Crime in which he totally got Jewishness wrong  Likewise there is so much wrong about this video  I used to watch Trevor NoahThe Daily Show every night  I stopped doing so after this video  I told everyone I knew to boycott it  I would be happy to share with you what I wrote about Trevor Noah and to connect with you email or messaging  Thanks Fern

A 73 year old quotbeefquot  UmI think you39re missing several centuries in there
how could the first cavemen be Palestinian and Israel when Israel was formed in 1948
Where is he now He is very quite He is more concern about the ticket sales for his shows and presenting at Grammy Awards than being the person he 39pretended39 to be It was all BS about humanity and values that he told on this show I have so much respect for John Cusack and Mark Ruffalo to speak out about humanity freedom and justice for all  a hrefhttpwwwyoutubecomresultssearchquery23onedeadchildonetoomanyOneDeadChildOneTooManya
But if you can39t beat me why are insisting on doing it its disrespectful and the situation is not the same at all
What Trevor noah is saying is Palestinians are Hamas
Your first mistake is assuming this quotconflictquot is quot73 years oldquot
I don39t agree at all    the Bad guy is the zionists from the beginnin to the end
I love him deeply  but as usual from quotOutstanders quot its easy to quest No I don39t know the answer  But I39m curious to know what39s his position at the moment seeing one one the most corrupt countries at the moment  with very very deep racial story has the courage to take the position of quotPalistine quot Non existing besides the roman quotPalestina Syriaquot label 
And yet this is more than 2yrs old manfacepalmingmediumdarkskintone

Arabs and Jews are literally descendants of one prophet Abraham They39re brothers
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvNeZ4yXyzUG0ampt343543a yeap they did that
The British didn39t took the land from Palestinians but from Arabs and Turks the than rulers 
Palestine should surrender
Theres another question Why does Hamas continue to fire rockets and missiles from schools apartments and civilian occupied buildings The Israelis will WILL fire back when fired upon The Israelis send a warning message to the people in the area to let them know they WILL be bombing giving area occupants time to remove themselves out of harms way Hamas knows they are putting innocent people in harms way Why are the people staying once they are warned that the Israelis are firing back I believe its the 2 government forces that maintain the hate and the fight I know too many Israelis that want peace They sing songs with their children of having tea with their enemy They believe a leader will come and bring peace between the two states There is a large Arab population that lives IN Israel They live peaceably
Ahhhhh so THATS why hes not doing the daily show anymore
100 true
Looking at this in 2024 it39s tragic to see how wellintentioned Western people didn39t realize the Likudnik settler mindset and intent Because of the settler movement39s power Israel never had any will to deescalate and seek peace it forced the PLO to surrender and just kept going
Thank you brother I appreciate you brIma  a historian  I know this history brVery complex history of this part of this part of the world
Religion is the one thing that has never calmed any situation when there39s a clash brbrTrue Religion is the gas that39s thrown on the embers to ignite the fire
And this is why you lost your job Woww
This is food for thought If Nethanyahu was really worried about the Isralian hostagesthen he would have responded differently He could use the threat of bombing Gaza as a way to let Hamas release hostagesbrThe way Isral responded was exactly how Hamas thought they would By bombing and killing many Palestinians resulting in what we are wittnessing now has a backfire on Isral Hamas is a terrorist organisation as is the fascists Zionists government of Isral under Nethanyahu a terrorist organisation Both need to be stopped
Like if youre here after 1072023
Its so sad to see this video now after the recent very evident display of abuse of power foldedhands pray for palestine
In a post October 7th reality would you still say quotThey can39t hurt Israelisquot What a joke this video is
No lands were taken from Palestinians  by the  British as there were no Palestinians  then 
Tnx Trevor Nicely done thumbsup 
I just hard  to say what is in my mind  a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnsfv1AcAAvYhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnsfv1AcAAvYa
Trevor with all due respect but you are simplifying  and saying so much BS  Please educate yourself  properly without taking sides if ypu want to be respected  journaliats all what you say and show is limited footage one  sidedbrbrYou just create  a propagandabrbrGoogle a bit history and go back to 2 AD  as its easy to say who is wrong who is right
Its not difficult Stick to facts
Hamas slaughtered Netanyahu opposing lsraeli leftists in several kibbuzim and on a peace festival Imagine jews slaughtering Sophie Scholl and her friends during the holocaust same thing Pali islamists are on the wrong side of history no excuses
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv8SazutwDaEghttpsyoutube8SazutwDaEgsiF0cUwhXK0DtYLZRQabrbrDear Trevor You are welcome to hear an answer to the questions you raised Be the Force with you
If I go with your analogue of children the Palestinians are not small kids in the neighborhood but troublemaking bullies who are paid by others Iran and some Arabs countries to make trouble in the neighborhood Middle East Everybody in the Middle East knows it No Arab country wants Palestinians because they are afraid of them starting to do troubles in their country Take the example of Jordan 197071 Palestinians started fights with Jordanians bombing shooting et but the Jordanian King was wise enough to depress these uprisings What about Egypt In the past Israel proposed to Egypt on multiple occasions to take control over Gaza but they repeatedly refused They are right Who wants to deal with Palestinians professional terrorists bullies murderers for a higher price who are looking to destabilize the whole Middle East
It really isnt that difficult
Completely agree with the children example
absolutely perfect question thanks Trevor
Respectfully I39m wondering what39s happening such that Mr Noah is silent on the Nabka
IN THE BEGINNING JEWS CAME TO PALESTINE SOUNDS LIKE HOW THE US GOT STARTED NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT HOW VERY SIMILAR THE TWO EVENTS ARE AND THE COMMON FACTORS
to me is clear who is the bad guy briam not saying the other team in totally inocente but the answer to oppresion always will be fight back
IDGAF just came to say that smilingfacewithsunglasses 
Of course you are sided with pro hamas and of course you mention dying children without mentioning that they are used a the tool currency weapon and shield for terrorists And of course you call terrorists a fighters  militia group anything but terrorists
If you think Gaza belongs to Palestine thats fine whats NOT fine is that belief justifying Hamas invading Israel first which they did horrifically Israel is fighting BACK against Hamas while Hamas was trying to wipe out civilians in the name of their countrys freedom
facewithtearsofjoy  Noah when you go way back in time those two cavemen hitting each other were brothers  The two groups have more in common than with the Europeans or the Africans or the Asians yet they hate each other  It is very sad in a very foolish way
This is one of the dumbest takes I39ve ever seen  Essentially  quotWhat does it matter who instigated the attack the nation with the more powerful military should be the one holding backquot  That39s some deep thinking right there
What can we expect from a people who have suffered almost 80 years of oppression and racism and whose lands are seized by the Zionists of course the resistance
brIsrael is therefore a victim of its victimspersonshrugging

Brilliant insight that tragically is still so relevant Thank you Mr Noah
The isrealis did everything right gave Palestinians official positions within the Israeli government gave Israeli citizenship to Palestinians granted LGBT rights to its citizens brought in thousands of foreign refugees even gave HamasPLO another chance and then it all comes down to nothing as they where attacked and now being slandered and dragged through the mud by their allies and their own citizens well no more mister nice guy huh Israel The kiddy gloves come off and the isrealis we know from the bible come to the light and fight to win

Go back 75 years when these immigrants hadnt yet landed in Palestine Im not even Muslim but Im not blind either
Way more NazisGerman civilians died during WW2 Does that mean they were right and we should39ve just let them be
The most real Daily show unlike the other clowns
I agree But I cannot share this video or any of my thoughts on PalestineIsrael conflict because an overwhelming majority of my FB friends and compatriots hold a very vocal and visibly painful for them proIsraeli position and I dont want to be ostracised

One of the only true things Trevor has said Im a very republican personrollingonthefloorlaughing 
so Palestinians quotcan39t hurtquot Israelis because of the power imbalance Tell that to 1500 grieving families Yes Israel is stronger and can inflict more death But that doesn39t mean it needs to quotnot retaliatequot when its people are killed idiotic take with a wellmeaning quotoh gosh idk im just trying to helpquot face
The British didn39t take the land from the Palestinians as Trevor Noah said at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvNeZ4yXyzUG0ampt164244a  They took the land from the Ottoman Turks Well actually the League of Nations allowed the British to administer the land as a Palestinian Mandate  a future homeland for the Jews  All of this was before the Nazis by the way despite what Noah implies brbrSo why are people viewing commentary from a person who clearly didn39t even do a wikipedia search on the history therebrbrThere has never been  at any point  a Palestinian Arab state in the region we now call Israel  Indeed there has never been a Palestinian Arab state at all except the one also formed by the British Jordan  And if you39re wondering why all the refugees can39t just go there you might want to look into Black September and the events that preceded and caused it when the PLO assassinated the Jordanian prime ministerbrbrBy the way just since 2000 the Palestinian Arabs have been offered point blank their own state by Israel three separate times and I39m not even counting the unilateral Israeli decision to give Gaza over and forcibly expel all the Jews from the area  But despite anything you might have heard the Palestinian Arabs have shown no interest  ever  in having a state balongsideb Israel and at peace with her
Do they bomb schools in America under school shootings with a warning signal
Breaking HUMAN RIGHT LAWS constantly under ilegall occupation how is THAT COMPLICATED brbrThey become a state without PalestiniansArabs having anything to say about it
1 The British did not take the land from Palestinians the Ottoman Empire control the land 400 years and there where never Palestinians it was Arabic people living in the territory called Palestinebr2 What did he say about they cant hurt you  I wonder if he thinks the same after October 7 th brI wonder if he expects Israel not to retaliate now 
Remember this USA citizen
True I know that Israel is the stronger of the two so to many it seems like theyre punching downbut that seems like some kind of fallacy because in a way thats saying no one should ever win Like if Palestinians get stronger and start winning theyll be punching down toobrbrLike if two sports teams go head to head no one would tell the team thats winning to ease up to allow the other team a chance to win Thats not the point brbrBc if the underdog starts winning theyre not the underdogand then you cant root for them You gotta root for the new underdog Its so ridiculous Just keeps flip flopping lol
Palestine was at peace with  Jews Muslims and Christians of all races living together with no problemuntil 1947  That39s when the problem started and the worst violation of International Law began to happen and has been going on for 75 years  and the United States and Britain are complicit    War crimes and genocide   Pure and simple  not complicated
You should do thorough research on this and any other topic for that matter brbrDuring apartheid our struggle was against colonialism racism and the dehumanisation of the indigenous people This is the same struggle of the Palestinian people brbrIsrael is an occupying settler and terrorist people That39s the reality of the matterbrbrListen to the lectures of Professor Noam Chomsky a Jew from the US You39ll benefit alotbrbrIf you are unable to do thorough research rather stick to comedy because you cannot try to satisfy both sides
So well spoken This is how I feel and couldn39t put it into words
You forgot that they are children of Abraham Sibling rivalry
Trying to state Palestine and israel as a conflict is so manipulating Its much more simple as Zionist try to portray Palestine was a country that holds Muslim Christian and Jewish Palestinians In 1948 Britain decided to help make a Israel state then the nakba came where Palestinian were forced out of there homes and land through straight violence and acts of terror  Finally if this is not clear enough that israel is a terrorist filthy state and should not have even existed since its existence started by war crimes  genocide and ethnic cleansing then you should learn about humanity  Free Palestine
They cant hurt you If only that were true
if Americans see January 6 completely different and it happened just three years ago with multiple angles televised livebrbrcan you imagine this over 70 year old conflict of existence Its tragic
Thank you Traver I39ve to be very careful so that my comment doesn39t get shadowbanned or taken downbrThe powerful country that you speak of hasn39t just taken over that little powerless county next door in my opinion they have even taken over the US In the US no one has the guts to speak the truth and point out the enormous injustice that has taken place because if they do they risk losing everything In the US you can think and say whatever you like about any politician yet one does not dare to mansion the name of one of them people from the powerful country One small piece of evidence of their absolute power and control over the US is this very comment I just can39t write it in a normal way and can39t express my opinion like a normal person due to the fear of being band or losing my account and access So basically get in line and support them or get the heck out

39Israel39 today has no recognition in English Law Neither 39Balfour Declaration39 nor 39Palestine Mandate39 ever formed part of English Law All three came from Britain39s illegal war on Germany in 1914 which breached our 1848 Treason Felony Act Palestine entering British Empire in 1917 was thus unlawful unconstitutional and remains unlawful today It has to be given back to Palestinian Arabs
There would be peace today if jordan army had not crossed the jordan river in 1948 and colonized judea samaria and east jersusalem
brIn 1948 after Israel declared independence end of british rule Jordan army crossed the Jordan river into Judea amp Samaria known as the west bank by MSM and east Jerusalem The Jordan army killed or drove away the Jewish people The Jordan army then destroyed Jewish property or took it over Jordan then encouraged Jordanian settlement in the occupied land Jewish property not destroyed became occupied by Jordanians After the Israeli victory in 1967 and Jordnian disillusionment with their expansion effort 1988 Jordan revoked the Jordanian citizenship of quotpalestiniansquot in Judea amp Samaria known as the west bank by MSM and east Jerusalem For the most part quotpalestiniansquot are leftover Jordanian colonist Gaza residents more closely tied to Egypt The homeland of the majority of quotpalestiniansquot is Jordan
From the Axis powers He went to see Hitlerwell documentedTruth in its entirety please
quotThe Palestinian people do not exist There are no differences between Jordanians Palestinians Syrians and Lebanese We are part of one people the Arab nation Lo and behold I have relatives with Palestinian Lebanese Jordanian and Syrian citizenship We are one people It is only for political reasons that we carefully endorse our Palestinian identity Indeed it is of national interest for the Arabs to encourage the existence of the Palestinians in the face of Zionism Yes the existence of a separate Palestinian identity is only for tactical reasons The establishment of a Palestinian state is a new means to continue the struggle against Israel and for Arab unityquotbrZuheir Mohsen 1936  25 July 1979 was a Palestinian leader of the Syriacontrolled asSa39iqa faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization PLO between 1971 and 1979
The Jewish population of Palestine was 10 in 1918 brThe British allowed mass migration to raise European Jewish population and total Jewish minority of Palestine to 33 in 1948 These are not Palestinian Jews but colonizing Europeans largely armed and trained by UK brThen Zionist terrorists were rewarded with a nation by far away nations against the wishes of all local nations and with zero regard for Palestinians self determination
If you pay attention the Jewish resistance was called a terrorist group in the news of the hotel bombing now they are praised in Israel for their participation in the independence That sounds familiar these days
There was and is no Palestine
I think its hard to understand 1939 How scary it really was Having entire nations fallAnd people just gone What if Germany had won We can overlook the war But should not We are to close to wars again
A sophomoric book report  What this documentary fails to address is the historical betrayal of the Arabs of the Levant  The quotintelligentsiaquot of that day was so adamant about the emerging state being quotmoderatequot that the word quotPalestinequot was preferred over the truth  The Levant has only ever been known by the residents of this region by five names and never all at once  Cannan Midian Israel Judea and finally Samaria  Palestine is itself a Helenistic exonymn inherited by Rome from Alexander the Great39s maps  It was the quotPurplesquot or Phonecians Tyreans which brough Caesar39s ire down on the region and as we all know Caesar destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem then exiled everyone associated with the Herrodian Kingdom of Judea  Despite what Jews insist they were not all dispursed across Europe just their aristocracy Nobility and Clergy anyone capable of leading the resistance to Caesarean authority  The majority of Judeans Jews remained though made no attempt to reconstitute a Civil authority after Caesar39s apartheid regime fell  That was a serious mistake since a state without a government is easily confused with no state at all   During the Islamic Caliphates and the Ottoman Empire Jews and Muslims lived side by side with no existential struggle between them at least not on a scale experienced in the 20th century  The problem for Muslims of the Levant is that the promise of the Caliphates and the Ottoman Empire is that both regimes pursued a single state one defined by theological borders one which obscured all preIslamic quotnationsquot Kingdoms  When the Ottoman Empire failed Arabs in all other regions restored their traditional Monarchs and asserted their traditional status as Kingdoms Muslims of the Levant had no historical context to which they could resort  The Muslims and Israelite Samaritans of the quotNorthern Kingdo of Israelquot preempted a return to that historical obscurity by declaring independence as Lebannon in Abramic origins Lebanon is just the defeated Northern Kingdom of Israel   If you are saying that Israelis have no historical claim to quotNorthern Israelquot you are correct   That divorce was final in 600 BC though the region remained an quotautonomous vassalquot of Asyria until Caesar invaded and occupied the Levant   Which brings me to the people we call quotPalestiniansquot today  Who are they  Palestinians are Muslims living in the former Kingdom of Judea the day Britain abstained from casting a vote to decide the regions fate   I believe Britain39s Abstention is the wisest decision the British Crown ever made  But history has indeed dealt the quotPalestiniansquot a cruel fate for they were effectively rendered without a legitimate identity by an quotinteligentsiaquot more invested in subtextual rhetoric  Given the choice between being called Midian and being called Palestine Muslims of the former Kingdom of Judea chose to abandone their father Abraham in favor of a listing in the quotPquot section of the international directory  Today Palestinians of Israel the only Palestinians in the world by the way find themselves with no true advocates among their Muslim brothers and sisters  Gazans are reeling in shock that their violent rising against Israel on October 7th was not a panArabian call to arms to drive Israelis all into the sea  Gazans should not be surprised they are without allies in this atrocity because no place called Palestine has ever existed until the Israelis of the Levant reassert self governance  Israel even the Koran acknowledges has existed precisely where it is for millenia  Arabia39s Muslims are many things but they are not fools Arabs know their children will inherit this lie called Palestine Palestinians will remain friendless in the region until they acknowledge their Father Abraham and restore their birthright as Midianites  I do believe in a two state solution Israel amp Midian  Palestine is a nightmare based on a semantic allusion a nightmare which should be brought to a peaceful conclusion Amen
Good video couple of errors 1 The number of Jews expelled from Arab lands after 1949 was over half a million 2  Israeli Arabs enjoy full equal rights together with Jews
While depending on one39s perspective one can find issue with one aspect or another of the presentation overall I found it to be informative and balanced  an impossible scenario steeped in tragedy  Perhaps more mention could have been made of the Jewish fighters who were not merely trained by Britain  they composed the Jewish Brigade that was active in So Europe 194445  In any case kudos to the presenter and the Imperial War Museums

The 39West Bank39 is Judea the ancient land of the Jews 
br
brThe Jews are from Judea where the Judean mountains runs along the spine of Israel where the tribe of Judah had its tribal allotment The Jews are the native people of the Holy Land The Philistines came from the Greek Isles originally these modern Palestinians have no relation to them at all They are Persian Egyptian Bedouin Turkish Syrian amp Arabian mostly
br
brThe term 39West Bank39 is a modern term with no historical significance There was never a country called 39Jordan39 before the modern state of Jordan was created out of whole cloth by Great Britain using 75 of the 39mandate for Palestine39

brSee the pattern yet
It appears to have the same source as many conflicts The well armed conquerors of the land make descisions that seriously affect the cimmon man without taking the commoners needs the majority into considerstion Conflict and choas ensues
Looking at the territory managed by Egypt and and yet ruled by Iran imams  and what has become of it And now looking at the land managed by Jews  brand makes you see literally what it means to have proper leadership and unity of people
The dirtiest of all British moves was how they intervened to save the Egypt army from being surrounded and wiped by the IDF and by threading Israel with invasion if Israel didnt stop its operation
This program is a travesty Land alloted them NOTbr UN plan was just one of many plans it was a recommendation it had no force of law there was NO legal palestinian territoryThe birders of israel were set as all others eg jordan iraq syria by posidetis juris Jordan illegally occupied Samaria and judea 
The world should not forget 6million jews murdered
At a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpjtQ4Jmxh8ampt8601420a the 260000 number of Jews immigrated from Arab states is incorrect over 850000 were Expelled as thr Arab League gave notice that Jews in Arab and Muslim countries were to be considered as citizens of the new state of Israel their businesses were boycotted they were fired from government jobs their citizenship revoked their men and women arrested as Israeli spies they fled to Israel with only the clothes on their backs They had property equal to 4 times the lsndmass of Israel confiscated by the Arab states and are owed over 160 billion in property stolen from them
At a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpjtQ4Jmxh8ampt7501230a  the information on Plan Dalet is false Dalet is the 4th letter of the Hebrew alephbet and was the 4th plan of intelligence gathering by the young Israeli state It was not implemented as it was information not actions
Lets go to 200 years before that
You ignore the mandate included Jordan and Syria Those were the countries given to the Arabs Lebanon was for the Christians and Isreal for the Jews All that land was called Palestine and everyone in it could be referred to as Palestinians The United States of America just took in five million refugees of all different religions and ethnic identities The Arabs of Jordan and Syria can absorb a couple million refugees that speak the same language and are of the same religion Isreal is for the Jews
At a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpjtQ4Jmxh8ampt289449a you stated that many Palestinian Arabs took up the Allies cause in WW2 They stood behind Hajj Amin al Hussaini and backed Hitler please supply proof of them supporting the Allies
So the British area in the ME was given to Hussain as promised via Iraq and Jordan  whilst initially the remaining mandate was to be for the Jews brAnd when the British limited migration to the area now understood to be Israel and the Occupied territories it was basically a stab in the back It would seem from this that the Arabs in the region have no right of ownership only of residency
The video states that the White Paper of 1939 issued in May 1939 was issued a mere 30 minutes before the death of Herr von Rath the German diplomat in Paris whose murder shot on 7th November 1938 dying 2 days later was the pretext for Kristallnacht It is difficult to reconcile the fact that Kristallnach was on 9th and 10th November 1938 with the White Paper of 1939 having been issued before the murder of 9th November 1938 which was the pretext for Kristallnacht given the chronology outlined above Or TLDR The Imperial War Museum is totally wrong about a chronology and cause and effect
What about the Zionist group39s interest in supporting Nazi Germany against the British Plus their terrorist bombing campaign against British politicians within the UK
Not once did you mention arab oil money
No disrespect but the Jewish people do have a receipt for Israel it39s size and the shape it39s in the old testament
Palestinian is in the Middle East for Arabic Muslims Jews Christians atheists amp Polytheism Theyve been living peacefully together for thousands of years before the Invasion of Zionist colonists
It is not a conflict it is an quotccupation and partheidstate
Honest question Has anyone ever seen anything like the hate the Israeli Zionists have in thembrHow can a people and a state have sooo much vicious brutality in thembrbrWhat kind of monstrosity was unleashed in 1948 when this despicable illegitimate state was created brJust look at what theyve done to little children to churches and hospitals to journalists to a whole peoplebrThey have surpassed the Nazis in every inhumane way they can Any person or organisation standing by them is not only immoral theyre actively destroying the human based values we live by in the free world
It was arabs land and still is It didnt belong to the British or UN to give to anyone else
there was never a palestinian nation  the name been given to the land during that time jews muslims christians druze and others lived here
Where did the newly formed Israel get its arms
Wait a minute it was the Jewish people in Palestine that started the irgun which committed terror against the British Menachem begin was a terrorist and then a prime minister of Israel
when you build a freeways that only Jews can use its apartheid when keep evacuating Palestinians from their homes to give to some one from Poland or Russia or Brooklyn its apartheid when a pregnant women die bcz the cheque point and cant reach a hospital its apartheid when kids cant make to school bcz of walls in their villages its apartheid I can go on and on on on stop your stupidity facevomiting 
Thank you for let us know the true
Almost the whole Palestine Land was occupied by terrorist Israel
No the conflict began already 1921 when the British split the Mandate in favor for the Arabs and Muslims they called it Jordan because at that time no ArabMuslim would call himself with the none arabic name Palestinian With Jordanians attack war and occupation of Judea and Samaria 1948 with the removing of all Jews killing all who could not flee in this area and calling it Westbank sharpened the conflict All Arabs and Muslims came during the different arabicmuslim IInvader times but most came during the British Mandate and Jordanians occupation time brPeace will come just when the ArabsMuslims understand that they are invaders and sit on the land of the Nation of Israel
Many  that remained in darkness and think that the land belong to Israel learn to know the reality
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Moral of the story it39s all Britain39s fault
quotOn the last day of the Mandate the Chief Secretary of the British Administration called a press conference in his Jerusalem office One of the journalists there asked quotAnd to whom do you intend to give the keys to your officequot quotI shall leave them under the matquot was the replyquotbrbrThat was Sir Henry Gurney his Mandate era diary published and commented by an Israeli historian Motti Golani makes a good read for anyone interested in the conflict beyond the headlines
Ironic that the prospect for Palestinian statehood emerged as a result of Israel39s SixDay War and its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip but not before that when these territories were under Arab control by Jordan and Egypt respectively
The Palestinian people are among the strongest and bravest on earth End the occupation end the humiliation PalestinianTerritories 
Zionism has made sure that Israelis are never safe as the people they pretend never existed  a land without a people do exist Zionism requires a quotfinal solutionquot for Palestinians brZionists didn39t colonize Palestine with the intention of becoming part of the community that already existed there They came to displace and exclude the people of Palestine from their homes and land physically and politically Its really no surprise that this hasn39t worked out well for anyone is itbrIf zionists had been inclusive instead there would be a very different situation nowbrContinuing the apartheid Continuing the genocide will not result in a sustainable future for Israel
Did you see that the Jewish resistance before the establishment of Israel was against military installations and not against civilians  On the other hand the Palestinians now
People forget that israel in 1900 was almost empty Half million people lived there barely
Had the chosen the borders differently and not annex Jerusalem there wouldn39t have been such a big mess So it39s all sides39 fault Jews wanted a stepping stone to expanding the boarders Arabs sensed it but at the same time they refused to compromise Arab nations helped them first but then they made peace with Israel while Palestinian resistance terror hasn39t ended since So 3 sides of intelligent adults should have gotten vetter results
Palestinians started this war I am telling this as an unbiased Turkish Because of Iranian government they became radicalized and didn39t end violence as well
Enjoyed this and would like to see a part 3 maybe even part 45
And this is the explanation about why there can39t be a peaceful solution to this conflict The UN two states solution has been botched by both parts and although the original one state ideal in which both Arabs and Jews could live together in peace would be the ultimate solution this will never happen
I applaud IWM for exploring this topic brat this time brhowever brthe word quotimperialquot in the title of the institution does not instil brbrin me at least the sense that it is a fair summary brthe machinations of the British imperial lite in the Near East made conflict inevitable brit is striking that almost everywhere the empire upped and left brusually in the lurch was subsequently consumed by violence
When britain received the mandate over the region palestina included jordan Britain divided palestina in two and gave the eastern part to the Hashemite family from Saudi arabia in exchange for their help in first world war before that during the ottoman rule the entire region was called syria palestina Britain and france divided the territory between them in a secret agreement  called sais picot agreement  frane received syria and lebanon and britain received palestina that includes today jordan The arab were angry because they want big arab state big syria there for the agreement between Faisal and weizmann from 1921 was faild
Bringing up the Sergeants Affair and ignoring the context can39t be chalked up to YouTube timeattention limits or summarizing   brbrI get the agenda here is to try and be quotbalancedquot or quotneutralquot and it39s not a bad job at that brbrbut a lot of the actions of the American colonists in America prior to the Revolutionary War are no different than the Sergeant39s Affair in prestate Israel  brbrThe Brits had multiple Jews ready to hang the Jewish extremists took some Brits as hostages to trade   The Brits didn39t take the offer and paid for it Wether you agree support condemn or reject  you have to bring in the context  Can39t summarize and ignore context  It WAS an extremist action It WAS wrong  But the event had context
Sound  particularly in terms of the neighbouring Arab states willing to use the Palestinian Arabs as a cause but not wanting them as a peoplebrThe same situation applies todaybrUK has no influence on this issue now  protests in London and squabbling in the House of Commons just comes over as selfregarding politics
Jews could have found a home anywhere in the world but they went and destroyed Palestine
As usual the British are liars here toobrbrThe Arab alHusseini was not just a Nazi sympathizer but a close confidant and advisor to Der Fuehrer It39s said that he counseled Hitler on the quotJewish Problemquot by suggesting the Germans demand that the Jews wear a yellow star in publica practice implemented by Arab Muslim rulers on Jewish secondclass citizens in the Arab world
Thank you for the explanation
My God what a convoluted mess it is  really glad IWM is doing this and shedding some light on it for people like me  nonhistorians who still want to understand it all
Why dont they rename everything Caanan again  brbrMerge them all in one It predates 80yr kingdom of judah anyways
In 1936 the Palestinians were revolting They still are
We welcome you as a guest then you kick us from our own homeland
Historical note the hanging of the sergeants was a response to the Brits hanging members of Irgun in Acre prison
An excellent report showing once again that in terms of International Relations treaties agreements contracts papers are not worth the paper they are printed on Except as documents to be later in historical stories but only for a record of what was written down at the timebrbrNo Empire is built by being nice honest or fair All Empires are built by taking from those who can not defend themselves
Here39s a short history lesson about the ArabMuslimIsraeliJewish conflict
brThe 7th century is the time when the Arabs began to expand their Lebensraum and colonize the world
br
br63438 CE
brThe Arabs and Muslims invaded and colonized the land which later became Mandatory Palestine They not only colonized the future territory of Mandatory Palestine but also millions of square kilometers of land that belonged to other cultures They gradually Arabized and Islamized the conquered populations
br 
brThe Arabs and Muslims ruled over that region until 1918
br 
brDuring this period Jews and Christians had dhimmi status Dhimmis were second or even thirdclass citizens with limited rights Dhimmis had to pay a special tax Jizya for their protection It is similar to what mobsters ask their victims like small shop owners to protect them from unexpected accidents and deaths So no they did not live in harmony or peaceful coexistence
br 
brA geographical entity called Palestine did not exist during the period of Arab and Muslim rule 6341918
br 
brThere were plenty of signs incl statements made by Arab leaders shortly after WWI and up until the 47 UN partition proposal where Arabs declared that if the effort to establish a Jewish majority state continues it will end in unrest and wars
br 
brPart of the territory of the British Mandate for Palestine do not confuse it with Mandatory Palestine was the territory of modernday Jordan
br 
brIn 1922 the British gave the Arabs 75 of the British Mandate for Palestine Hint the modernday Jordan
br 
brOn July 24 1922 the League of Nations issued a formal recognition of the Jewish nation39s connection to the Land of Israel and approved the decision to establish a Jewish national homeland in the territory of Mandatory Palestine
br 
brIn 193738 the British offered them 83 of the rest of the British Mandate for Palestine which became officially known as Mandatory Palestine All together if the Arabs hadnt refused the 3738 proposals they could have ended up with c 96 of British Palestine under their control
br 
brIn 1947 the UN proposed a plan for the partition of Mandatory Palestine into an Arabmajority state and a Jewishmajority state The Arabs rejected it
br 
brSide note The boundaries presented in this partition proposal never became official
br 
brMay 1948
brAccording to the principle of international law known as Uti Possidetis Juris the whole territory of Mandatory Palestine became Israel at the moment of the declaration of independence in May 1948 In other words Israel is not an occupying power
br 
brThe Arabs invaded Israels territory almost immediately after the declaration of Israel39s independence because they wanted to erase it from the map
br 
brIsraelis failed to fully liberate their territory from the invading armies so JudeaSamaria and the territory that later became known as the Gaza Strip remained under illegal Jordanian and Egyptian occupation until 1967
br 
brSide note between 1948 and 1967 the Arabs expressed zero intention to establish an Arab majority state called Palestine in JudeaSamaria and the Gaza Strip eg see the Article 24 of the PLO Charter from 1964
br 
brSide note The Arabs of that time didn39t selfidentify as quotPalestiniansquot
br 
brSide note The socalled Palestinian ethnicity and the myth about the stolen Arab land of Palestine were invented by a handful of Arab leaders with some help from the USSR during the early 1960s In other words there39s no scientific or historical evidence that supports this myth For example there39s no archeological evidence that an ethnic group called Palestinians or a geopolitical entity eg kingdom or state with the name Palestine existed before the invention of this myth in the 1960s
br 
brIn the 1948 war Israel acquired c 6480 km2 of land allocated for the Arab state in the UN39s partition proposal Neither the UN nor other organizations label those territories as occupied
br 
brSide note The 1949 armistice lines aka quotthe 1967 linesquot aka quotthe Green Linequot were neither political nor territorial boundaries aka official borders between Israel and its neighbors
br 
brYes some Arabs were expelled while others left because their leaders promised them that after they crushed the Jews and their state the Arabs could return
br 
brAfter the Arab defeat in the 1948 war the Arabs expelled almost 100 of Jews c850k from Arab controlled territories eg North Africa and JudeaSamaria
br 
brBetween 1949 and the early 2000s Israel offered the chance to return to over 100k Arab refugees multiple times eg during the 1949 Lausanne Conference The Arabs rejected those offers
br 
brIn 1967 during the SixDay war Israel legally captured territories from the Arabs
br 
brNow
brTake a look at the logos of Fatah and Hamas
br 
brBoth of them show the silhouette map of quotPalestinequot which they want to liberate It is quite odd that it resembles the silhouette map of Mandatory Palestine In other words both Fatah and Hamas would love to erase Israel from the map and replace it with an Arab and Muslim majority state
br 
brAs I said before the Arabs had many opportunities for establishing an Arab state called Palestine Instead of focusing their efforts to hinder the Jews from establishing and maintaining the only Jewishmajority state the Arabs could have turned that energy into creating a peaceful Arab state something like Singapore 20
br 
brConclusion
br 
brThe ArabMuslimIsraeliJewish conflict exists because the ArabMuslim ego cannot accept the reality that they lost to Jews their former Dhimmis a tiny piece c022 of their colonized territories
br 
brThe Arabs and Muslims rejected even the idea of an independent Jewish majority state
br 
brBetween 1937 and the first two decades of the 2000s the Arabs and Muslims rejected every offer to establish an independent Arab state called eg quotPalestinequot Here39s an example Check out the YouTube video with the title quotOlmert offered Abbas 20 a hrefhttpsqkmsqkma more than size of West Bank according to PLO Chief Negotiatorquot
br 
brIn other words the goal of the Jews is to have a state while the goal of the Arabs is not to allow the existence of that Jewish state
br 
brHistorical facts prove that the only ones that make the lives of the Arab people miserable are those eg Arab leaders Arab states the EU and its members the UN and various NGOs that made a lucrative business model out of it who perpetuate this conflict those eg UNRWA who teach hatred towards Israel and Jews to Arab people not Israel Again the Arabs could have built a Singapore 20 if they truly wanted a better life
br 
brFun fact
brAccording to an Arab pcpsr dot org survey from 2022 51 of Arabs in Arabcontrolled territories in Judea and Samaria and in the Gaza Strip 61 Gazans want to wage war with Israel while 21 support negotiations

Um no The Israel39palestine Conflict began 1400 years ago Your displayed map graphics are DISHONEST btw 39palestine39 was a mandate never a country also when you say that word strangely you show a red area only covering modern day Israel In reality the geopolitical area called Mandatory 39palestine39 covered all of modern day JORDAN as well The truth is the Hebrew ancestors of today39s Jews built Jerusalem with their own hands not tens not hundreds but bTHOUSANDS of Yearsb before Islam was invented in a cave Indeed when the Romans took their turn stealing the Jewish land then called bJudea amp Samariab  and had their turn squatting in it they REnamed the entire greater area iquotSyria Palaestinaquoti solely to removehide the Jewish identity and connection to their own land So here we are today the indigenous population of that land have it back they share with anyone who doesn39t want to kill them The colonial conquers SQUATTERS39 name of 39palestine39 has been scrubbed the fallacious and pervasive concept of the 39palestinian39 as a national identity persists It is possibly the most ingenious and insidious deception Islam has ever invented c1967 They can pretend that there was once a great nation called 39palestine39 with a rich history dating back to the Cretaceous Period if they like but anyone with an IQ above room temperature knows better None of yourtheir sophistry or ridiculous historyrevision will stand in the face of facts They stood aside in 1948 while the massive arab armies promised to 39kill all the Jews and drive them into the sea39  and then THEY LOST They didn39t get to come back These arabs and their supporters call it a 39Nakhba39 a 39catastrophe39 which is really rich Every year we say loudly quotNo we will not help you mourn ithe day you FAILED to kill us alli quot  Legit these people mourn that they bfailedb to commit brutal genocide that is their 39catastrophe39 facewithtearsofjoy  Funny thing about war is if you try to commit genocide and YOU LOSE you can lose land  if you fight a war as the aggressor and YOU LOSE it can be inconvenient for you Just ask Germany about that huh This entire population has been lied to by UNRWA that they shouldn39t settle that they shouldn39t make a better life for themselves that if they just give birth to enough offspring and teach them to hate and to obsess over nothing but slaughtering Jews that eventually ione day they might 39win39 the 1948 War of Independence39i  for real they can39t wrap their head around the fact that they lost 70 years ago They are so butthurt about losing all wars they star since then that they just keep trying again and again expecting different results Meanwhile Israel is doing what it does best inventing stuff Exporting lifesaving medical technology Creating startups that solve problems Terraforming the desert Excelling in arts and science amongst other things There is a reason why the emblems of all these 39palestinian39 groups have AK47s and swords and knives on them and the emblem of Israel has 2 olive branches But also Thank Gd for the Hagana and the IDF  Am Israel Chai OKhandmediumskintone  Israel 
imagine all of your neighbors stole everything you own and tried to exterminate all of your People no one in their right mind would want to go back to living next to those who did all that to them
Oh at  last Zionism and terrorism  talked aboutmany people seemed to forget this
I commend this channel for telling the truth and not being racist towards Jews
Europe should have given the Europeans Jews a state since they lived in Europe or simply accepted them in their native countries after the war
It39s been tragedy heaped upon tragedy for both countries and the people living therebrbrWith brute force and terrible reprisals and apathy for the other side one side has been able to partly forget about this brbrUntil recently anyway
We the British should have had nothing to do with Palestine A huge mistake like others there after
I very much enjoyed your video and I gave it a Thumbs Up
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpjtQ4Jmxh8ampt27027a just watch the beginning of this video and understand how the whole conflict began and then understand that the Palestinian people have a right to defend themselves and their land its like the British in Northern Ireland killing more and more people in Northern Ireland and then moving towards the southern areas of Ireland and then they start building settlements in Ireland and continue to build and kill the civilians and control everything from roads and checkpoints to access to food and resources including water Now imagine that  Do you think that the Irish people would not fight back against this oppression And do you think the world would behave like how they are behaving towards the Palestinian people
it39s wild how Palestinians think that they deserve 3  States but Jews shouldnt even be allowed to have one Smh
How many times have a group attacked another to take over a resource and that has rippled over time and place until it can extend over much of a continent IMHO this is a ripple of Hitler if not beforebrThere39s a whole uninhibited continent available to live in and mine for the resources
Why were the British there in the first place and in India and in Ireland and in China Causing trouble all over the place
Seemingly no one wanted israel to exist at their own expensebrThe jews didn39t even try carve out a state in europe and they were still forced to flee brIt39d be pretty naive to think they wouldn39t see similar treatment elsewhere especially after the legendary zionist paramilitaries carved out the state of Israel and did so in a rather impressive military conquest
The British remained in the region long enough for the Jewish population to establish control over the situation a plan that was formulated as far back as 1917 Their pretense of impartiality was merely a facade This is indicative of how white supremacists operate
There are some interesting interpretations of some of the events in this video  Palestine has never existed as a country it was a vilayet within the Ottoman empire the local tribes did not observe borders and did not have a homeland
In the long history of this land despite being the birthplace of the major religions it has known so much bloodshed brConqured by the Muslims circa 640AD then by the Christians in the First Crusade in 1099  the massacre of Jews and Muslims alike by these quotknightsquot  lacks the chivalry we would normally associate with knights  brI fear this land will never see peacea hrefhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSiegeofJerusalem636E28093637C2A0httpsenwikipediaorgwikiSiegeofJerusalem636E28093637 abrbra hrefhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSiegeofJerusalem1099textOn201520July2010992C20theJerusalem20were20filled20with20bloodhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSiegeofJerusalem1099textOn201520July2010992C20theJerusalem20were20filled20with20blooda
Incorrect in the video there were 850k Jews with a history of over 2000 years who fled and were persecuted in Arab countries not 260k
I39m not picking a side but it is rather impressive how Isreal started with nothing and 75 years later they are a regional superpower
Failed to claim an Arab state and defeated the war they started What else needed to say 76 years later
I39m not sure one could truly say Britain quotlostquot to Israel I think they more or less just threw their hands up and said to hell with it y39all deal with it
Israelis government is committing genicide and palestinians are at the risk of it according to the UN report
Palestine as a country never existed so it could not quotwiped of the mapquot
FANTASTIC Video Did an amazing job showing how both sides are guilty of terrible acts towards one another and even towards themselvesbrbrI hope this goes viral so people learn the actual history and not the AntiIsrael or AntiPalestinian versions we see so often today
When will Jewish states be established in all other MiddleEastern and North African regions from where almost all Jews have been expelled and genocided out
There is so much space on the planet Why not pick another location for them to settle from the beginning Like idk south america east russia or whatever Now both groups share a tiny bit of land and they freaking hate each other I doubt there will ever be peace Its unsolvable at this point
Thanks for the video Informative and well presentedbrLets hope there will eventually be some semblance of peace in the region whatever that looks like At the end of the day it is innocent people who suffer
The conflict between Jews and Arabs in IsraelPalestine began with a few incidents at the end of the 19th century but really didn39t kick in until after WWI So it39s about 100 years old It does not stretch back into the mists of antiquity  please spare us those ridiculous phrases The ArabsMuslims didn39t step out of Arabia until the 600s AD The JewsIsraelites ruled Israel for about 1000 years until 70 AD Israel was under foreign occupation until 1948 but there were always Jews there though the majority lived in the Diaspora after 70 AD
Omitting the fact that the Arab leaders told Arabs in Palestine to leave their homes ahead of the fighting is incredibly misleading The blame for their flight is placed solely on Jews in this summary and is inappropriate especially when using terms like Nakba without explaining the meaning behind the Arab term setback of their goal total control of the land by Arabs
You keep calling it Palestine Please could you inform me exactly when Palestine has been an independent sovereign nation As far as I know an independent Palestine has never existed whereas Israel has a long history of existing
A decent attempt at being impartial factual and informative This is a really interesting summary into the ArabIsraeli issues in the modern era Anyone watching just needs to keep in mind that this has been going on for much longer than 2000 years All of this has happened before and all of it will happen again
I shall leave them under the matbrbrWhat a classic line Imagine someone saying something like that in a press conference in 2024
Thanks for putting your archive resources into manageable format for nonhistorians like myself for citizens in a democracy need to know something of the past in order to lobby representatives for a just solution to present problems
Is a twostate solution possible between Israel and Palestine brComment below and join the conversation

It really sounds to me like The Palestinians have been the problem from the beginning They just hate Jews and cannot tolerate the idea of a Jewish state next to them They want everything and thats that Israel seems to be more than willing to compromise At this point I say F Palestine and Israel needs to take over the entire country Is what it isbr     FAFO
Insha Allah Palestine will be free Amen

Pilki mam you are awesome reporter and lecturer Very clear and entertaining Thanks mam and God bless you
Aren39t you ashamed to fabricate it in this complete false manner
The Jews believe it is their original homeland and the Palestinians want pre  1967 bordersOnly God can bring peace
During the otrule the entire area that is now syria jordan and israel was called syria palestina there were no borders When the first jewish settlement began in 1882 the population was sparse and most arabs lived in villages The jews setlers settled in places that were not inhabited or in places they bought from landowners The living conditions of the first settlers were very difficult  they had to drain swamps there were many diseases such as malaria There were also settlers who could not live in such conditions and returned to Russia The fate of the settlers who returned back to Russia was bad and they were murdered
Thanks Pilki Your report is wonderful light shining in the darkest corners of the history of state of Israel and Palestine Bravo

I love history
The entire land is Israel the homeland of Israeli jews since 3000 BC for 45 centuries brbrIsrael existed sinceb3000 BC  But Israel was invaded by successive world empires  The last of which is the muslim Ottoman empire   and most of the Israeli  jews were driven out from their homeland brbrThey returned to their homeland in 194748
This is why I respect First post news and documentaries well researched
Well articulatedim now satisfied with what i hearThanks
The madman hitler created the problem of Israel and Palestine
So it basically means that jews want palestine no matter what the issue is they will use politics or force to occupy and if the palestinian try to defend they39ll use both power to manipulate amp still nobody has the idealightbulb  to solve it Right
The Bible said that God will bring the Israelites back to their homeland and He did bring them back
listen thiers a reason you are a journalist and not a historian first palestine was the fourth place chosen becuase zionism and jeduaism do not mix  zionist are athiest so to say palestine was promised to jews by God is a lie so athiest bealieve in God when it suits them second israelites where dark skined hebrews your history lesson is full of shit 10s of thousands of people  thiers more palestinians then jews by 3x
I would also like to point out a couple of thingsbrbra hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvGRembMmMQcampt120200a  It39s not that important but the Jews called themselves quotIsraeliquot not quotIsraelitequot quotIsraelitequot is used in English Bible translations The term that Jews used to describe themselves was quotIsraeliquot and for other people groups in their era for example quotCanaaniquot written as quotCanaanitesquot in the English translation of the Bible quotItesquot is an English way of describing Biblical people groups There are no quotitesquot in Hebrew brbra hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvGRembMmMQcampt316516a  So many facts and details are left out of IsraelPalestine conflict Sorry but it39s sketchy and shallowbrbrFirst the land that was called quotPalestinequot now Israel had scant and stagnant Arab Bedouin population from the time between the middleage crusades and 19th century which grew from 200000 to only 300000 during this period because of harsh living conditions there The land was nothing but a wasteland with large areas of marshy swamp brbrAnd much of the land was owned by rich nobles who did not live there but lived abroad in prosperous regions of the Ottoman empirebrbrWhen they started selling the land to the Jews those were the worst pieces of their lands and that too at exorbitant prices as compared to rest of the world at that time even if compared to thenland prices in Europe amp America But the Jews with their hard work and commitment to settle in their ancient land converted the vast marshy wastelands into groves brbrAfter the development started to kick in the area it witnessed mass migration from the surrounding Arab regions  people who came in search for better living standards But just as today the big cities get populated in slums because there are not that many jobs for all the people migrating there was a problem of excess of labour which increased the misery of those migrating from the surrounding Arab countries brbrIf this caused the IsraeliPalestinian problem then that should apply to other regions in the world too For example between the Blacks amp the White Americans though the situation between Israelis amp Palestinians was never half that bad But the Blacks never vowed to annihilate the Whites nor issued violent 39intifadakind of violence39 against them For example where can one find this as a part of Black freedom slogan quotto kill every White till none remainsquot But this has been the Palestinian militant attitude towards the Jews since the early 1900s and since before and before brbrThere is a long and continuing history of fatallyviolent statements by the Arab leaders against the Jews amounting to genocide Does the media ever bring this to notice that their main leaders were publiclyopen friends of Hitler This could all be found easily in the news archives and history accounts ironically not in a very distant historybrbrSo there was a religious angle to it all as well There were Jewish and Arab settlements side by side and scores of Jewish settlements were rampaged by the Arab militant factions and the massacres of the Jews was not uncommon since the early 190039s This also led the Jews to maintain their own private militias
br
brThe Peel Commission in 1937 offered a partition plan which gave Jews about 20 of the land but the Arab leaders rejected it Then the 1948 mandated partition split the land about equally to both the Jews and the Arabs but again the Arabs rejected it br
brThey had always been rejecting a sidebyside existence with Israel and kept refusing the 2state solution until very recently when it39s too late

History as it is
Her accent is a real turn off
You39re not only a news anchor but a special teacher who teaches more than many professional teachers do through news presentations You39re unique and the best
and lastly and of utmost importance the Palestinians do not want a State based on the 1967 borders they have been crystal clear that they want only a single Arab state from the river to the sea and from Lebanon down to Egypt
You have provided a very unbiased and clear presentation of the history I would just add one very important clarification You imply that the Europeans were to blame for Jewish discrimination  and that is absolutely true But we must emphasise that a massive number of Jews were dispelled em masse from many Arab states leading up to and following 1948
Thank you for telling the truth
Palka sharma is really good with words and broadcaster But you still can39t beat ace
quotMuslims never presecuted Jewsquot Christians commited atrocities on Jews becoz Jews murdered Jesus
The jews returned to the land which is promised for their end In simple word the geginning of the end has started for jews U people study quran to know real history of this unthankful and conspirator nation jews They r dispersed in different parts of the world becoz of their conspiracies and not following the laws set for them in jewish religion They always forgot the mecies of Allah
As a Palestinian and before I watched it I thought oh here is another bs video for of lies However I was so surprised that it wasnt Well except for a tiny detail when she said Palestine want whats theirs and thats from 1967 no it was 1948 Another important part she missed was Jews werent buying lands they were refugees with no money they were given weapons and they just stole everything in sightbrbrThe reason Israelis agreed to 2 states is because they were getting free land to people without land and the reason Palestinians rejected is because they would lose more than half 55 of their land brDo you blame them
What happened to the Biblican history  The Lord God gave the land to Israelites

False the peel partition was rejected by zionist and palestinians ofer to  live with them and give them rights So dont bent reality lady Facts are wtiten in history already also the partition plan was basicaly the divizion of palestinians with 3 other conties having autority over themif someone do that tl my county i would not accept either so isnot palesinian foult also you refuse to tell that the zionist  movement refuse to negociate with the palestinians and only ask  brithish   what they wantgrinningfacewithsweat  totaly fair Partition plan not accepted by both state and they still dont care and refuse further negociation and of course lets take more land then as they were better prepared
So this is the same story for all parts of the world  America displaced native Americans  Africans Indians  imagine if these people were allowed to get their land backbecause GOD was a realestate agentand These Jews are terrorists
This seems to be a one sided description of what occurred  Those paramilitary groups of Israels attacked Palestinian towns and forcibly removed the populous  There is much blame to go on both sidesa 2 state solution seems to be the only way out of constant war  But that has to be equitable and neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis can be trusted to come up with a fair plan  The UN must broker a deal and all parties must agreea compromise that will be painful to some but will also begin the healing process
The forgetful presenter did not say that the Arabs once captured the entire Middle East and northern Africa with Fire and Sword destroying almost the entire male population of all countries She forgot to tell that after the end of WWII Britain and France as the victorious countries received instructions from the League of Nations to rebuild the defeated Ottoman Empire Both countries received Mandates from the League And new countries were created Iraq Bahrain Qatar Kuwait and others Under the Mandate for Palestine Britain was supposed to help create a Jewish state on the territory of the former Jewish statebrIn 136 AD The Romans expelled the unconquered Jews from their country They plundered the Temple and built the Colosseum in Rome And in the arena of this Colosseum they began to openly demonstrate their morals against which these rebellious Jews fought In the Colosseum arena men had sex with men and women with various animals including wild ones The cannibals chopped and tore each other into pieces devouring the defeated opponent for the amusement of the spectator And in order to further humiliate the Israelis they renamed the country Palestine which in Hebrew is consonant with plunderedbrIn WWI Britain was ready to enter into an alliance even with the devil in order to gain victory And after the victory having received the Mandate she farmed it out to one nomad brother  the bandit Iraq Other countries had already been formed Another nomadic brother a bandit began to make claims against Britain recalling to her his past merits Wanting to pay off Britain divides Mandatory Palestine into parts and gives 66 to a bandit  a sheikh This is how Transjordan appeared on the territory of Left Bank Israel With Hitler39s rise to power Britain issued a White Paper and based on humane considerations severely limited Jewish immigration  At the same time Britain made great efforts to drive Arabs from different countries to these desert landsbrThe remaining part of the Mandate was cut into separate unconnected pieces and given to the Jews These were mainly malarial swamps and waterless desertsbrJews fleeing pogroms and antiSemitism agreed to such a division But the Arab League an ally of Hitler did not even consider the possibility of providing asylum to Jewish refugees The Arabs were confident in their strength They have been acting by force for centuries and destroying everyone in their pathbrThis is how Muslims created the Beautiful Country  Pakistan at the cost of the lives of 60 million HindusbrThe Arabs attacked Israel immediately after the announcement of the creation of a new state In addition to the five surrounding countries three more countries sent their troops Leaving Israel Britain not only took away all the weapons but also declared an embargo on the supply of both weapons and food to the young country British officers with WWII and WWII experience led many Arab armies and divisions in the war against Israel All Arab countries in the region expelled the Jews most often with a bundle of things in their hands but sometimes without things In total the Arabs expelled about a million Jews Some went to South America Australia but more than 650000 were accepted and assimilated by Israel whose entire population then amounted to 650000 people And that39s not the whole story
The presenter accidentally forgot to mention that the very term Palestinians was introduced in KGB training camps in 1964 in order to somehow distinguish this group of Arabs from others Egyptians Iranians Iraqis Pakistanis Syrians and other fighters for communism quot Well they couldn39t call them Israelis Soviet antiSemites simply did not turn their tongues at this It was in these camps that they were taught to attack and seize embassies planes and blow up buses with children Three years later five Arab countries with huge armies armed with hundreds of thousands of pieces of equipment from the same USSR attacked Israel and the nickname Palestinians came in handy
brBefore this for 2000 years only Jews were called Palestinians and were driven from everywhere to your Palestine
Dear Its hard for me to believe that you dont know the details of the creation of the state of Israel and the illegal formation of transjordan This means that you are well aware that no state of Palistine has ever existed just like the people of Palestine These socalled people of Palestine are the descendants of Arab migrant workers who came to Israel from neighboring Arab countries after the start of Jewish immigration at the beginning of the 20th century
br    Can you really imagine that the creation of ANOTHER ADDITIONAL new Arab state will change anything And this is in the presence of 22 Arab and 38 Muslim countries occupying an area of more than  13 million square  kilometers I hope you will agree that this is not a territorial conflict at all but an existential conflict 
br   This was openly stated by Mr Erdogan who claims leadership in the Islamic world threatening war with complete destruction of the Jews the crusaders and all infidels  If you are not Muslim then you are definitely among the infidels who are subject to complete destruction  I am sure that you are aware of this and understand that this is not a slip of the tongue of an inexperienced politician  It39s time to stop turning a blind eye to the obvious

br                   There is a war of Islam against the WHOLE WORLD
br                  Israel simply found itself on the first line of defense

brBorrowed from a friend
brA little more history for those wanting to 39restore Palestine39
brIn 132 AD the Emperor Hadrian resolved to stamp the Jews and their religion out of existence He sold all Jewish prisoners into slavery after the revolt of Bar Kikhba forbade the teaching of the Torah renamed the province Syria Palaestina and changed Jerusalems name to Aelia Capitolina He renamed Israel to wipe out the national identity of Israel and the Jews
brSo if you are looking to 39restore Palestine to the Palestinians39 you need to give it back to the Jews

Palki Sharma is GOAT
Those converted Ashknazi white European Jews belong in Europe Palestine was beautiful country before zionst arrive there Herzl wrote in his diary in 1897 Jerusalem magnificent city as I imagined European style those squatters need to pack and head home
Jews move to Palestine homeland during ww2 not their homethen why  is jews take over arzb landwho is god and why he mess the world upfor me there is no first second people
I would like to add that during Utman empire Jewish Cristian and Muslim did not have any problem But British and its alies forces created this blood shed for a political and economical reason which you see now The free using of Red Sea and Swiss Canal

In the midst of the IsraelPalestine conflict the toll on civilians is profound and deeply troubling The urgency for a swift and comprehensive peace agreement is paramount Innocent lives are being lost families are torn apart and communities are left in ruins The international community must exert collective efforts to address the root causes of the conflict ensuring that both parties commit to an immediate ceasefire and engage in constructive dialogue Humanitarian aid including medical assistance and support for displaced families should be prioritized to alleviate the immediate suffering Only through sustained diplomatic efforts can we hope to build a foundation for lasting peace fostering an environment where all communities can coexist and thrive

Yes they are criminals No dought
Sadly the Israelites government together with USA are are arrogant and are conducted a genocide not at all caring if what they did is killing or acts of war crimes
Thank you Yannis We need your voice urgently Keep going foldedhands foldedhands foldedhands  in the name of justice  int human rights and compation for humanityvictoryhand crossedfingers globeshowingEuropeAfrica redheart  From Danmark
Israel has had military supremacy in the region since the 1960s If they want to kill or remove all ethnic Palestinians what is stopping them
I generally enjoy listening to Yanis but he is talking complete rubbish here and deliberately removing all nuancebrbrThis is Hamas propaganda not truth
Read some history books Yanis
Israel owns the US Congress and POTUS There are so many AIPAC funded politicians and in the USA Yet AIPAC is exempted from filing as a foreign agent
Thank you Yanis  echo every word you say   May God bless you with long life of health and happiness redheart foldedhands 
The more things change the more they stay the same The Police and military fully support these corrupt individuals so the problem is much bigger than you all talk about
Billionaire businessman and philanthropist Warren Buffet calls cybercrime the number one problem with mankind and cyberattacks a bigger threat to humanity than nuclear weapons
The dark web is also where cybercriminals buy and sell malware exploit kits and cyberattack services which they use to strike victims  including businesses governments utilities and essential service providers on US soilbrbrA cyberattack could potentially disable the economy of a city state or our entire country
Cybercrime To Cost The World 105 Trillion Annually By 2025
Most modern economic systems operate using computers Attackers can target computer networks of economic establishments such as stock markets payment systems and banks to steal money or block people from accessing the funds they need
What Is Cyber WarfarebrbrCyber warfare is usually defined as a cyber attack or series of attacks that target a country It has the potential to wreak havoc on government and civilian infrastructure and disrupt critical systems resulting in damage to the state and even loss of life

It is too much for kind people to bare
It is heartbreaking to witness a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvw53SeU11yqsampt53053a  the children being pulled out of the rubble like rag dolls  We obviously do not live in a democracy anywhere
I admire Veroufakis
This is correct the modern state of Israel should never have been created due to the misguided English sentiment and the UN after the second world war  feeling sorry for the Jews and their admittedly inhumane treatment by the Nazi39s  Isn39t it ironic that the Jews have shown that they are no better than the Nazi39s in their treatment of the Palestinians  unbelievable when one contemplates this
October 7 was NOT a setback for Israeli intelligence The government knew that the attack was imminent and they allowed it to occur in order to implement their agenda of destroying once and for all the legitimate state of Palestine
They are only criminals if the USA Britain and Germany and their fellow bum boys say so
Oh dont start me on these motherfuckers
Israel is evil and evil are helping them
Thank you very much Yannis for sparking up and standing with justice and humanity
This is one of the clearest most detailed yet simple explanation of the conflict and the grave and shameful acts of Israel and their allies Put a stop to it now and Free Palestine PalestinianTerritories 
NethanSusikBadenare Three war idiots
They call Gaza an open prison yet they build tunnels and shoot rockets fighting for what exactlt Israel was never theirs to begin with instead of make it a better place for their children Gazans will never learn
Yea by whose standards Hamas
And the number of Jewish people Biden has in his administration is staggering only his defence secretary is not Jewish no wonder America does not want a ceasefire
The problem is Islam this is the real issue and their theft and destruction of Israel the mosque on the mount is simply obscene and the theft of Jerusalem is a hideous crime why is it ok to kill Jews again Hitler tricked everyone with nice words look where it went and the GRAND MUFTI Al Hussein was part of that genocide a devout Nazis and it39s all FACTS not propaganda
Free Palestine
Thank you Yanis for speaking the truth thumbsup 
Israel is an apartheid terrorist occupier NOT A STATE The only rightful state is Palestine
Thank you yanni for your support
The worst its that they voted no c3asefire many times They send money and w3aponsbrNobody realize the truth
What  about  the genocide against  macedonians in  grece in 194849
Thanks for your voice Yanis we need more like you in leadership positions
I would argue Yanis39 final point Yes We in the West are responsible but indirectly Our taxes pay for these weapons but we have no say in where our tax money goes And there are very few people alive today who were drawing breath when Palestinian territories were first given to the Jewish people to form the state of Israel I39d hazard a guess that the majority of the populations of the West are against their hard earned money being spent on the decimation of a foreign population thosands of miles away just like they were against the illegal invasion of Iraq brbrTarring the citizens of Western nations with the same brush as their crooked politicians could also be considered collective punishment Most of us just want to live peaceful lives amp see the same for othersAnd see our taxes spent fixing domestic issues not fuelling the flames of everlasting war around the world that only benefits the same wealthy industrialists amp elites that control our politicans and have thereby brought our own countries to the brink of financial ruinbrbrI for one would rather see our politicians working towards the benefit of our own country not throwing our money away on war because lobbyists for the arms industry amp Israel gave them a backhander bribe sorry I mean quotpolitical contributionquot The Tories have been in Israel39s pocket for a long time but it is scary that we now have a leader of the opposition who owes his very position as Labour leader to the Israel lobby39s undermining of his predecessor via baseless character assassination Everything points to Starmer being completely controlled by the Israeli state From his betrayal of Corbyn a staunch and very vocal supporter of Palestine and his refusal to acknowledge the findings of the Forde report amp restore the whip forcing him to run as an independent to keep his constituency to the expulsion of Jewish party members who happen to be opponents of Israeli foreign policy to backing Israel39s collective punishment amp his double standards in calling out war crimes when discussing Putin versus discussing the actions of Israel since last October This guy cares more about pandering to a foreign power who are actively seeking to subvert our domestic politics than he does about the well being of the British public He is no different to Blair or the Tories They all pander to the United States amp Israeli governments while leaving us behindbrbrVote Green if you are on the left Vote Reform if you are on the right SNP if you are in Scotland Independent if you have the right candidate Vote for anyone but the 2 main political parties that have failed us for decades We need to do ourselves a favour and show these puppets they are not fooling anyone and plant the seeds of changing our electoral system to proportional representation so they never have the kind of majority needed to hold absolute power unchallenged ever again
You are a war criminal Rabbi A real disgrace
Netenyahu is clearly head of a Apartheid state Israelstill  killing about every day Palestines occupied Palestines every  day till 1947 and stealing the Palestines land and some if Palestines are called terrorists The USA are alsi complicit in genocide because the USA give weopans and money to the Jewish Apartheid state This is disgraceful and the world should be ashamed Biden is a war criminal and should be prosecuted I totally agree with your guest
Good Bless you Yanis for tellin the truth
So many mistakes from such a smart guy Do you really believe what you are sayingbrThe amount of people in Gaza are growing every year for decades while in your country it the opposite How is it possible in a Genocide

Wow u r speaking everything in Israel39s point of view and saying no bias Nd yes the attacks were going on Palestine from beginning where they didn39t get even basic facilities they counter attacked Israel for this Source of information itself is wrong The israelis r fighting for al aqsa mosque which is in Palestine that is why they r attacking the people Why will someone like to destroy their own peace  Just think on both sides n not on Israel point of view
Agreed  violence  and  war  is not the  answer   The  question is  who  is the illegal occupier  and  who   are the unfortunate  ones who  are being  illegally occupied  and  badly  treated  and  who is violating  UN resolutions  who  are  displaced and  living  in refugee camps   for  decades    where is  conscience  gone

The thing that happened on October 7 2023 was not a terror attack That was fighting for freedom that too since 1948 You should have studied history more before making this stupid video There was no Israel in the world map before 1948 They came as refugees which of course Palestinians have allowed and started occupying their land illegally If fighting for freedom is terrorism then i guess you are clearly saying that all our freedom fighters were TERRORISTS

Read the Bible brother
I want the daily updates about the Israel Palestine War
israel existed before palestine was a name
the romans has named the land of israel earlier called 39judeiya39 to 39palestine39 to remove the connection of jews with it as it is their historical homelandbrthe brittish after has kept using the name and called everyone living in it as palestinian this includes jews arabs christians druz bedouing and charkes sorry if I have missed anyonebrbefore the establishment of israel it was not the arabs calling themselves palestinians  but jews which then flipped after as anyone who stayed in israel started reffering to themselves as israeli instead including the arabs that didn39t fleebrarabs that have fled israel started calling themselves palestinians in an attempt to gain a quotrightquot for the same peace of land which despite the un suggesting a partition plan they just declined on gound of wanting the whole land for themselves and not wanting any jews in it nor a jewish state to be existing this is also why a two state or a one state solution won39t work now as well unless palestinians change their way and are happy with what they do have  for example gaza

bro you forgot the part that izrael was way before palestine
The First Temple in israel was in the period 1000586 BCE marks a significant era when the Kingdom of Judah was established in Israel This shows that   jews lived there before arabs
Palestine wasn39t even identifyed as a thing
Satanism at work
Wtf right does the UN have to enact a policy of ETHNIC CLEANSING brbrThat39s a crime against humanity no matter who does it
Additionally 34 of the Arab population of British Palestine  arrived there in the 20th centurybrThe Arab population jumped from 350 thousand plus in the late  180039s to around 1 2 million by 194749 brAlso the Jewish place names of Jerusalem  Judah Samaria and the Gallilee all remained as they were Indigenous Jews and Samaritans still lived there During the Ottoman period Palestine was not even an administrative province It was not on Ottoman maps
FREE ISRAEL  this is BS    ISRAEL existed 1205 BC when Pharao Merneptah mentions that he went to war against thembrIsrael has existed for 3000 years while Palestine is a fictional country that has existed for 70 years

Cough cough the kingdom of Israel was in the early times but it was captured by the ottomans then the Jews felt and they called it Palestine then comes after ww2 in 1948 a proposal was made for the Jews to return to there home land so they did which was called Israel dummys
Israel is almost 4000 years old Palestinians was a name given by the Roman Imperator Hadrian to humiliate the Jewish people and erase their identity with their ancestral land Before this there was any Palestine On the Egyptian Merenptah Stele written in 1205 BCEbrthe Pharaoh Merenptah mentions the Kingdom of Israel and Judah Before this territory was called Syria Palestine there was the Kingdom of Israel and Judah
you are talking about this as if palestine wasn39t just the name of the land because the romans called it that way to humiliate the jews and like britain wasn39t always planning on giving palestine to the jews look at the palestinian flag during the british mandate looks pretty jewish to me
Free Palestine
Lets give the Palestinians a damn state and seek ways to make peace with it include giving them East Jerusalem which is mostly inhabited by Muslim Arabs anyway and provide them economic ways to prosper instead of constantly trying to control their way of life for the sake of security I think we would be much better off sealing our borders and not letting any of them into Israel while giving them their own independent way of running an economy such as with an airport high tech incubation partnerships and other means that lead to job creation there instead of herebrIm saying this as an Israeli

I love the fake history The Israelis had much less than 55 there are plenty of maps to confirm this Not only that they only gained most of it after the Palestinians aka Arabic residents of the region went to war to destroy any Jewish state If someone doesn39t know a lot of Palestinians are Jewish by dna Also they39re only called Palestinians because the Romans hatred of the judaeans and named the province Palestine 2000 years ago as a screw you to them BTW the Palestinians have gone to war every decade or so some involving the entire region They gave back the Sinai peninsula after winning the war against Egypt they gave Gaza to the Palestinians they gave other territories back too Hamas was immediately elected and then had complete control of food water education employment etc So every Palestinian death is because Hamas put them in front of the Israeli fire

This is all wrong we need to go back in history Israel has got independence in 1948 and Palestine in the 60s or 70s  Israel had some kingdoms way before a lot of countries Kingdom of Israel kingdom of Judah and kingdom of Jerusalem which was older then Roman Empire Palestine just got independence after empires has took the kingdoms of Israels land then collapsed And a lot of people dont know history at all like you so they think Palestine was first because British Palestine was before Israel in 1948 Kingdom of jersualem collapsed or was born in 1099 AD and Palestine I dont think Palestine was a think before 1099 AD and dont make up something saying Palestinian kingdom or empire in 3847 BC

The name quotPalestinequot originated from the Romans who used it to refer to the region after the suppression of the Jewish revolts particularly the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 AD The Romans renamed the area from Judea to Syria Palaestina as an attempt to eradicate Jewish identity connecting the name to the Philistines ancient enemies of the Israelites This renaming was aimed at erasing Jewish cultural and historical ties to the land The ancient name Judea was derived from Judah one of the 12 tribes of IsraelbrThus the people who inhabited the area including Jews and Arabs before the establishment of modern Israel became known as Palestinians
Before Palestine
And there were other people nations and religions before PalestinebrThat39s history they betrayed the ottomans and Germans for France and BritainbrLosed many warsbrAnd the country they get by UN was19x bigger than today the rest they losed for alone by starting war and losingbrbrA 2 state solution is a pro Palestine solution because the 1 state solution will be the state Israel
quotplan to partition the countryquot  partition what country The nonexisting country It was a plan to partition the land because it was devoid of a country
they have to go from were they came or they go to hell
Man learn history from hamas propaganda skull 
Israel was renamed palistine by the Roman Empire so uhyeahhh
Just a 1 sided video dont listen to him
Man in the high castle has more historical accuracy than this video and man in the high castle is pure fiction

Palestine never existed first free Kurdistan redheart redheart redheart 
We already went through all that and we are still suffering from genocide here in Ancient CemAnahuac aka quotamericaquot
That39s why i don39t trust UN
So this explains why the U N does Nothing to  Stopstopsign   the suffering of the Palestinian  People  The United Nations The  U S are all complicit in this genocide  Pure evil
All are Palestinian land Who give the British the right to create an illegal zionist apartheid regime state of isreal on Palestinian land
1947 the UN decided jews could return to their homeland Let39s go back a few thousand years before the land was conquered by Muslim forces shall we Better look at the land proposed before believing this video 4x the size it is now Isreal has only expanded after being attacked
How odd that this also looks lile how the Nazis would come in and take over other countries leading up to and during world war 2subhanallah
The truth
Great Britain defeated the Ottoman Caliphate  that gave UK the right to decide to recreate a Jewish state  the Arabs got Iraq Jordan AND half of quotpalestinequot   in 1920 hardly anyone was living in quotpalestinequot  ppl started moving in after Arabs and Jews  from all over  postWW2 the Victorious nations made up the UN  not the third world clowns who do now  and they were masters of the globe having vanquished the Axis   WINNERS decide  Israel accepted partition and chose peace  Arabs rejected it and chose war and lost
For anyone wondering it was a Palestinian British Mandate Not an official autonomous state Before that there was the ottomans and yaddayadda
The region palestina was Jordan   Israel  part of Lebanon  part of Syria  part of Egypt brThe palastinian received 75 of the land which is Jordan and the jews who lived in Israel got 25 of the land which was a swamp and desert  This was agreed by the United Nations more then 75 years ago The Palestinian jews arabs  Muslims and Christians and druz and beduin which lived in Israel then are still living in Israel in prosperity  brYour wishes to invade Israel will result in brDevastating consequences Why don39t you try to make life for yourself instead of destroying other people39s lives brHamas is responsible for the suffering of the people of the Gaza strip
Another example of the UN being absolutely harmful

It39s terrible that this is more relevant than ever

Good satire makes you laugh great satire makes you mad quotyes stupid you really let them do thatquot
If they just went slightly further back and mentioned the first Nakba they wouldnt be able to both sides this shit so hard Disappointing but it guess its 8 years old
0 I mean yeah this is a good video and you know is an interesting take and I know this is satire but you mean you kind of left out the part where it is really took their land and I suppose if someone took your home you would just to walk away and turn the other cheek because that39s the American way right Lol
Now you39re just reporting on reality
One of the onions greatest pieces
8 years later and it seems like it wasnt a joke
Sometimes I watch satire and think to myself maybe it was never meant to be funny
I39m a simple person I go to satire media outlets to inform myself and I go to major news outlets to readwatch the satire
This is a little touchy with me because of all the children I have seen dead the past few months in Palestine with Israel hitting full force   thank you for your work though very intelligent

Love thisredheart 
man i really have fun watching this channel but i hate seeing this typa quotboth sides are wrongquot shit the problem began when the british financed zionism to colonize palestine up until then the islam majority and the jew minority lived in reasonable harmony the jews didnt even have to compromise to the sharia law but the british wanted the population to be divided and to pretend the main cause of the distress was religious conflicts after so much immigration specially from europe two nations developed israelis and palestinians the twostates solution has already been picked and is visibly not what the zionists want the state of israel plans to expel the palestinians from their own land or else kill them right there palestine needs to be freed from the zionist entity and unified into a single and free territory the israeli families themselves come each from a different country so why cant both nations coexist palestinians just want the peace they lost decades ago back and even the israelis are tired of this shit hamas39s is an antizionist and antiimperialist political organization and is employing the al qassam brigades to fight for national liberation which the international law considers a just struggle as sad as it is watching thousands of lives at risk peace can only be brought by war if the zionists really cared even about jews or israelis they would end the occupation right awaybrbrfree palestine from the river to the sea PalestinianTerritories  long live hamas PalestinianTerritories  death to the zionist entity PalestinianTerritories

I think after enough time this issue of race or religion will resolve itself there wont be any left
Surprisingly prescient
Non parody gist people have been fighting over that area for 200000 years the most recent conflict is because the western powers decided to make an Israeli state there out of guilt that they stood by Knowingly while Germany killed millions

Had the Palestinians worked with the Jewish nation they would have been better off than fighting them This land had always belonged to the Jews It is their land and the Palestinians never going to get it back Now if you are a Palestine stop listening to lies of groups like Hamas Go and educate yourself get a good job and be happy
It is a super complex issue and I am really not an expert but I decided to make a 30 minutes video about it for clicks and views
It39s interesting there39s no nuance placed on the distribution of land in the UN partition plan Yes Israel got a larger share of land however almost half of that was desert and habited by the Bedouin who Israel was going to be expected to take care of Also the ethnic makeup of the Israeli partition was something like 60 Jew 40 Arab with the expectation that civil and religious rights would be upheld for the Palestinian population The Palestinian partition was somewhere less than 10 Jew with no expectation of having to take care of anyone else

Very poor documentary very uneducated on the actual history
Israel is a promise land
Everyone should read The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine by Ilan Pape An Israeli historian who uses Israeli primary sources It is the best book on the subject This issue is not complex It is unbelievably straightforward
pretty shallow reviewbr1  for example it is indeed true that the Israelis were offered more land but this quotmore landquot was 80 desert bralso you should have mentioned the real complexity of thatbr you call the israeli narrative simplistic but i don39t think you really know what the historical narrative really isbrbr2 also you say Itschak Rabin and show Shimon Peres brbr3 The Arabs attacked Jews way before 1948 you mentioned the Palestinian suffering alone and don39t mention the Hebron and Safed massacres in 1928 there is a reason why the Jews didn39t trust the arab population due to mobs attacks massacres in the past and so on brbr4 you mentioned the numbers of Palestinian refugees but didn39t mention the number of Jewish refugees from Arab countries which approximately reached the same number brbr5 The Arabs refused for any proposal no matter how much land we would talk about
From the river Euphrates in the east to the Mediterranean sea in the west from the mountains of Lebanon in the north and to the Negev desert in the south is the promised land for the people of Israel  If you divide that disaster comes to youbrStudy the KJV Holy Bible and be on the truthbrBe prepared for the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ
So the 700 thousand palastinians have the right to return
Thank you for your courage You handled a fragile topic well redheart 
Its horrible that we are called anti semetic when  being a Palestinian means youre Muslim jewish or Christian Free Palestine means that we want a secular state that doesnt insist on jewish supremacy or revenge on a people that did not cause the pain that their neighbors or the Europeans did
To clarify if you understand Arabic the nakba originally referred to the Arab failure to destroy Israel Read the press of the day 1948 Nothing to do with Arab Palestinians leaving Israel at the time What is also ignored is the Jewish nakba  except that Jews have never referred to their own flight as such  Jews were ethnically cleansed from Morocco Turkey Iraq Syria Yemen in 1948 It has been calculated that these Jews left behind property and land equivalent to four times the size of the newly created state of Israel
You think this all started with the Ottoman Empire You need to go back to School and learn History The Arab invaders have no business being there There has never been a state or nation called quotPalestinequot It was Judea before it was called Israel You know where the Jews lived before the Assyrians invaded and murdered the Jews who lived there The Jews shouldn39t have changed the name of their land to Israel They should have kept the original name Judea
Once upon a time there were Jews worshiping God in their land Then the Assyrians and Babylonian invaders took over and started to breed like ratsbr  After many centuries the Jews managed to reclaim their homelandbrThe Arabs as they are now known have been trying to occupy and take over Jerusalem and the entire Jewish state ever since Why Because it39s the holiest heart of Christianity and Judaism This quotIslamquot exists solely to wage war on Christianity and Judaism it is not a religion it is an excuse to subjugate women and wage war on the rest of the world What more do you need to know
The enemies news says it destroyed idf Why all over the news ga za is flattened and showing videos of crying Lies for sympathy

Imagine the Benjamin pent in order to keep the TRUTH of all this swept under the table This has been going on since the water well drilling Co39s from the UK and the USA discovered Oil and Natural Gas in the Middle East back in the early EARLY 190039s That39s when they started dividing up the lands and pitting one against the other and Promising quotsecurityquot and wealth
br
brThe report cited the Levant Basin Province comprising 83000 square kilometers of the eastern Mediterranean Sea with 122 trillion cubic feet of natural gas as one of the most important natural gas resources in the world Despite the fact that this reserve lies under waters bordering occupied Palestine Lebanon and Egypt Israel has claimed sole access and profits from this find 
br
brWhile the estimated volume of natural gas in the Gaza Marine is considerably less than the Levant Basin its proximity to the shore and lesser depth make it easier and less costly to extract In 2019 UNCTAD estimated the net value of the Gaza Marine natural gas could go a long way in addressing poverty in the region
br
brYet Israel continued to prevent Palestinians from developing and benefiting from their natural resources in clear violation of international law that governs who has rights to these resources when a country is occupied

The Jews shared Judaea with a host of other peoples whom had been transported there or had moved there on their own accord over the previous few hundred years The most predominant group was the Edomites who had moved north when the Jews were exiled The Palestines are also from Canaan and both sides are related whether you like it or not or should I say whether the Zionists like it or not You focus on the jews but you seldom mention all the peoples who lived in the area and still live there So because this is a quick dirty look at  a part of history not showing all the other peoples who lived there 39No let me bring you back to 10 march 1948 a group of eleven men veteran Zionist leaders together with young military Jewish officersbrput the final touches to a plan for the ethnic cleansing of Palestine That same evening military orders were dispatched to the units on the ground to prepare for the systematic expulsion of the Palestinians from vast areas of the country The orders came with a detailed description of the methods to be employed to forcibly evict the people largescale intimidation laying siege to andbrbombarding villages and population centres setting fire to homes properties and goods expulsion demolition and finally planting mines among the rubble to prevent any of the expelled inhabitants from returning Each unit was issued with its own list of villages and neighbourhoods as the targets of this master plan Codenamed Plan D Dalet in Hebrew this was the fourth and final version of less substantial plans that outlined the fate the Zionists had in store forbrPalestine and consequently for its native population39 This excerpt was written by an Israeli Historian Ilan Pappe

Way too little time made of use for this subject Thats your main issue if you are afraid your video has any
Forget about history of Israel and Palestine What can you do them now  How can you possibly bring peace and do better living for Palestinian How can you bring friendship between Israelites and Palestinian

I think is a very balanced and fair video about the conflict Some details could be added but then the video would soon be an hour long Here are a few important onesbrbr The terrorism in the few years leading up to 1948 was very onesided In 90 of the cases it was Jewish groups inflicting terror on Arabs and British to drive both out of Palestine This terrorism wasn39t some small rogue actors but came from the highest command including BenGurion The British knew this because they secretly wiretapped the Jewish leadership They decided to raid Jewish offices and collected very damning evidence for it which they stored in their HQ at the King David hotel The Jewish leadership panicked and had their terrorists blow up the hotel to destroy the evidencebrbr The 1947 UN partition plan was initially going to be voted down but the Zionists and their powerful allies stalled then bribed and threatened a few countries to change their vote in favor of the Zionists This was the first major task of the newly formed UN and many asked themselves how it already could be corrupted so easilybrbrbr While there were many kinds of Zionists the political Zionists soon became the dominant ones They never had any intention to share any land with the Arabs Their goal right from the start was to take all of the land They agreed to the 1947 partition plan just as a first step of getting all of the land This attitude has continued to this day Israeli settlers is the clearest sign that they never had any intention to allow a Palestinian statebrbrI can strongly recommend the Martyr Made Podcast on this subject Several hours of detailed info narrated in the style of Dan Carlinbrbra hrefhttpswwwmartyrmadecomfeaturedpodcastsfearloathinginthenewjerusalemhttpswwwmartyrmadecomfeaturedpodcastsfearloathinginthenewjerusalema

The incredible writing your narration and the editing of these videos is out of this world Thank you for your very important work

a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvOdENyo4HvX4ampt9741614a You miss out one crucial detail A damning one for the British They criminalised Jewish immigration to Palestine in 1939 Even more damning is the fact that they then place illegal Jewish immigrants into Detention camps in Cyprus after the war
A concisely comprehensive documentary Ashamedly I come to this subject not with an open mind Like so many in the West I39m the dupe of decades of political and media brainwashing Israel good Palestine bad Your video has corrected this fallacy I now see that for more than a century the Palestinian Arabs have suffered a monumental injustice which has proceeded in plain sight right up to the genocide of today Since October 7th 24000 Palestinians have been slaughtered and nearly half of them have been children History echoes with the sickening emptiness of the words quotnever againquot
One could wish that Netanyahu would make the world his classroom and present this history in detail and ask us to hold sympathy for all the people in these places as most of us now feel after watching this
Thank you for the video and the book reccomendations
I know that if we were to go through all the quotes from any political figure of the early 1900s we would eventually come across at the bare minimum with some mildly racist comments I sincerely believe that this would be true even for the most progressive minds of that time br
brNevertheless that particular quote is disturbing even for it39s time
You cherry pick Muslim perspectives Most of them are not valid You point out times Jews did bad stuff but ignore all the times they did bad stuff You seem to want to put out a balanced perspective but you really haven39t
You can not judge God by saying to him he is liar God is the judge not you
If the people have tried to make the human robotic super man for the absolute progress therefore they shall deserve infinite heavens but why God does not perform that pragmatically
Thanks for being so thorough and precise Not taking sides or at least almost not taking sides Anyhow I39d just like to add that you forgot to mention hopefully  unware that the very creation of Jordan as an Arab state on BRITISH PALESTINE constituted the creation ofAN ARAB PALESTINE Shortly before saying quottwice promisedquot you showed a map of Palestine in purple However that was not the full lenght and size of the real Palestine under British mandate That said the obvious conclusion is that although the UK had given the portion of land to a NON Palestinian arab from the Hashemite tribe that country created on top of British Palestinian land is nonetheless PALESTINE itself We can conclude without shadow of doubt that the division of the remaining land between Jews and Muslims was not over the entirety of Palestine Thus Arabs muslims control over 80 of Palestine  whereas the Jews only 20 That is an important fact to be put into consideration
The ongoing war in Palestine where Israel keeps pummeling Palestine has become a first rate tragedy for the whole world is it not  In this developed world with AI and what not this tragedy has been dragging for the past 70 odd years Is there no solution for this seemingly un soluble tragedy  I as a citizen of the planet has spent a lot of time when sleep eludes me  This is the proposal  The state of Israel could be statutorily dissolved  Do not take me wrong and I do not advocate the death of a single Israeli or Palestinian for that matter
brIsrael has about 8 million citizens  Suppose Israel supporting countries led by America which unequivocally support Israel paying a heavy diplomatic price for that support could take in about 2 Mn Israelis into America and so could large countries like Canada which a huge land mass but no populace Australia which is more or less the same Both these huge countries could take in say 1 Mn Israelis each  In the case of Germany it has a special a nexus with the world Jewry in part due to it Holocaustian past from which collective guilt still emanates  Germany took in l Mn Syrians in to their country and Syrians are different from Germanic races Not so Israel
brThere are other European countries like Portugal Italy England et El  How France another nexus laced with guilt as the Vichy Govtdeported a large cohort of Jews to crematoriums in Germany Now we are almost there Some could even find citizenship in North Korea should not be surprised at all Isralis could send rockets to space more efficiently unlike NK made ones which disintegrates in midair Russia which has a decreasing population problem could accommodate 1 Mn Israelis and send them to develop Siberia Even Iceland could accommodate Isralei Jews and send the down to places where volcanoes erupt so as to deal with them 
brSo what of the now emptied state of Israel which now no more Muslims all over the world would be salivating at that prospect and these lands could be turned over to the long suffering Palestinians who would be happy to occupy the lands they lost at the creation of Israel  I conclude and would be happy to elaborate re my brain child to anyone who is interested in a win win situation for all the stakeholders
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvOdENyo4HvX4ampt13502230a those words could have been said by Hitlerbut it was Churchill Shame 
Thank you so much for this video I honestly had no idea of half of this I feel I have a much better of the situation now
I cant help but to feel like this presentation is purposefully much more favourable towards the Palestinians It seems like the narrator ponders for minutes on all the Jewish wrong doings will just briefly mentioning all the massacres the Palestinians committed

One commenter said you were yt formatting wiki pages and a couple later someone links to wiki This despite you citing the 3 books you chose as sources at the beginning of the video I personally found it to be pretty fair from my own previous understanding so thank you
This is the slanted Zionist Hasbara
the jews always had a presense in the middle east and racially jews are of the exact same race as the people of the middle east jews and palestinians are both over 70 decended from canaanites so there is no such thing as anti semitism in the middle east only when israel was created on palestinian land did we see a rise of hatred for jews and often focus on hatred of eurpean jews who where more agressive in their ideology of wanting to create a state and who used significant violence against palestinians
Skipping back and forth between years and decades made this too confusing to me
You make ethnic cleansing seem so friendly and necessary And in the end you admit that you are not an expert Useless information I listened Free PalestinianTerritories

Some details were glossed over includingbr1 how Arab population which was less than 200000 in the 19th century to 700000 in 1948 It was because the Jews who purchased land invigorated the economy of Palestine such that Arab economic migrants started coming into Israel for their livelihoodbr2 that the naqba came about when the invading Arab leaders told their fellow Arabs to leave Israel so that it would facilitate the extermination of the Jews That they ended up refugees after the loolss of the Arab armies is a natural consequence of their treachery

Hey there really nice effort but the problem with using any Islamic sources is that they are bound to be peddling falsehoods brbrSuch history books are written for the West as all believers  are commanded by Allah to lie to Kafirs  brbr So your information is already wrong when you say that they were half a million Arabs in the early 1900sbrbrSo here are the accurate facts and its a shame that you did not bother to check them before making your documentary brbrYou must always check facts If they come from an Arab sources for the West they are duty bound to lie about virtually everything  Anyone who does not see the matter of this mid East conflict as relatively straightforward has been confused deliberately by an onslaught of propaganda coming out of Islam Sadly your effort only adds to that narrative which is fundamentally falsebrbra hrefhttpsenmwikipediaorgwikiDemographichistoryofPalestineregionhttpsenmwikipediaorgwikiDemographichistoryofPalestineregiona

So you got this people that show up to a land that other people are already living there and they say our God gave us this land and kicked the people there out Then they got kicked out then they came back and kicked the people out there then they got kicked out then they came back again and are currently kicking the other people out So history teaches us and repeats itself that the hebrews will once again  kick out the  people there in that land then they themselves will get kicked out  This is a very god documentary but it should have started around about 1000 bc
Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem At that time the Canaanites were in the land The Lord appeared to Abram and said To your offspring I will give this land So he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to himbr     Genesis 1267
I admire that you seem to neither condemn nor defend either side in this tragic conflict I am left feeling that this a complicated problem with many points of view
Jordan Soldierts rocking Jewish from old Jerusalem  and destroy most Jewish history from old Jerusalem No Jewish on Jordany last Clearly Israel and Jewish did not tray to destroy Arab on land and even on 6 day war was as ending war Israel helped return Arab People on land by helping Arabi cross Jordan wall and even clearly to teach Peace Israel lets Islam to continue on Hait Holy Jerusalem to keep asking tempt to respect and respect all religious to visit it So da Islamic not only fight between couple Islamic but also clearly prohibit Jews to pray religious quotPeacequot 
Funny not to clear come History and forget plenty Jewish seems only by Europe to forget dat Jewish leaving on land by longest dan any overt people regardless by all people trying to take over Arab also started to incoming bigger dan earlier dan some pretend Arab started to move every body as lost time of Turkey one may understand amount of people and how small on land dat Turkey treated like so small dan using for Suirti Jerusalem was mixed but only few having it last great Turkish and Arabic Islamic did not care of such important Any way as Arab went in went by seeing Jewish and also Arabik killing not also politic but criminal dat shown plenty careless It was not even a name of trying an in dreaming name until 1961 dat PLO head a Egypt born competed all his groups to take quotPalestinequot and even writing quotto take name of Pelestinewould be good to invented a History to usedquot so we must not learn Now plenty to have equality and respect has tray many times Now way quotPalestinianquotPLOquot never compleat Peace regardless plenty to observe Now read plenty of PLO as well as majority teacher day declared a country without Jews and also declared to kill Jews completed and learned plus antiSemitism taking Hitler and Nazis papers plus plenty of teaching and friendly for such quotArabiquot becoming and continue Nazi politic plans So all creates with we may not have by two people on Peace Criminal and defense really shows way it is only Jewish Israel works Humany and accepted for Earth  How to do would only teaching wrong Arabi quotPalestinianquot dat Jews are Human and accept Peace
Churchill did not hold anything back facewithopenmouth 
This video has a GLARING omission I39m not Jewish nor Arab But the Zionist response to the 1939 White Paper is kind of crucial They rejected a democratic state with representative government and literally resorted to terrorism against the British in 1939 THen came WWII and the holocaust during which they paused their activities Once the war ended the zionists launched a campaign of terror against the British who had just saved European Jews from Hitler and that caused England to flee the region During this time the 1939 white paper was in effect and being implemented All the jews that had arrived there got there illegally It39s also worth mentioning that nearly all Jewish immigrants to palestine between 1882 and the start of the British Mandate were illegal immigrants as wellbrbrThis is the crucial piece of the puzzle that explains why the Zionists were seen as violent extremists by the British and the Arabs and explains why that 1947 partition plan was so ridiculously unjust compared to the 1939 white paper plan  It also exposes the true motivations of the Zionists who had NO intention in living in an arab majority state even though the Arabs were literally the majority and that this is the foundation of democracy
Its not complicated at all The Muslims should have GIVEN Israel to the Jews as their historic homeland Its still possible Muslims should do that today It would be the right thing to do  and save Muslims from their curse of backwardness and religious obsession
thank you for this
You forgot the Bible

Settling in the only part of the Middle East that has no oil as Hitchens commented
The pro Palestine  comments have gone quiet
China redheart 
Based on this as neutral as it was made still shows that Israel continued to take over the space that was original to Palestine and it literally explains they have been controlling Palestine territory for a long time Palestines dont need to be controlled in their own land
So in 1700 the Jewish people settled there and the rest are colonizers
So Ottoman Empire lost in WWI doesn39t that mean Palestine technically is still Allied  British  country
Lets get this straight the Land of Canaan  was called palestina by the Roman Empire there was never a land called Palestine or people called Palestinian they came about in 1960 so lets stop the bullshit that Palestinian were there for many centuries its all bullshit thats a fact end of story
This video is proPalestinian And not mentioning who started all the war
The pie chart showing my the percentage of land allocated to each side was wrong And its not sixtyday war its sixday youre saying it wrong
Don39t need this video just got to read the Bible all these questions are answered and no secret
Small correction During the time of the ottomans the entire area that is today syria jordan and israel was called syria palestina Syria was given to france in the sies pico agreement Britain divided palestina into ywo and gave the eastern part of palestina to the Hashemite family from Saudi arabia as a gift for they help in first world war There for the arabs actually received a much bigger area then the jews and most jordanian are actually palestinian
how long was the six day war
IT WAS A 6DAY WAR 6 DAYS NOT 60  6 AND ONLY 6

just letting the creator of the video realize a mistake Its 60 day war not six
Ancient israelites are not modern Israeli
So60 million have seen this story full of holes and innaccuracies 60 day war When was thatbrBTW what happened to all Jews expelled from Arab countries Now what happenned to Arabs expelled Actually arabs were not expelled They were told by their leadership to leave and could return weeks later after arabs won The  only problem being Israel did not lose that war the Arabs that chose to stay in Israel have voting rights careers and sit in Parliament none of those qualifies as apartheid Nor does a massively growing population qualify  as a genocidal rule
Cannan was originally inhabited by huntergatherers and soon mixed with people from Persia and Turkey Abraham came to Cannan and settled there for 100 years after that He then went to Egypt where the Jewish people were enslaved They returned and defeated the various Cannanite groups This video conveniently skips over the perspectives of the other groups that resided there

so this land belongs to Israel  cus they had the land first before Palestinians come in
I wonder what the support would look like if Palestinians and Jews were switched If the arab world was a Jewish world and Palestine39s were the only arabs living in a world of Jews Exiled from the land multiple times over centuries then had half their people killed and tried to come back to their homeland Land taken from Jews who eventually became occupied by Palestinians Who would be right Both sides or one side Two station solution It39s a hypothetical scenario Not taking a side so if you39re gonna hate do it somewhere else
Like all nations Israel and Palestine is built on conquest Cant see anywhere why Israel should be worse than anyone else in that regard Earth belongs to no one and everyone its all about power Sore losers it seems Also they denied the first treaty and went to war from what I can see
Not real this Palestine land
                             
According to the Holy Koran  Allah gave the territory of the State of Israel to the Jews the sons of Israel This is the will of Allah Therefore  any attempt by the Palestinians to take over the Jewish state  stands in total opposition to Islam
I am currently learning this topic in school admis what is happening right now in Palestine I am learning so much more than I ever would because of how much my school loves to glorify America and the soul topic of US history I loved this video and it was very helpful

Islam I evil
Dear Its hard for me to believe that you dont know the details of the creation of the state of Israel and the illegal formation of transjordan This means that you are well aware that no state of Palistine has ever existed just like the people of Palestine These socalled people of Palestine are the descendants of Arab migrant workers who came to Israel from neighboring Arab countries after the start of Jewish immigration at the beginning of the 20th century
br    Can you really imagine that the creation of ANOTHER ADDITIONAL new Arab state will change anything And this is in the presence of 22 Arab and 38 Muslim countries occupying an area of more than  13 million square  kilometers I hope you will agree that this is not a territorial conflict at all but an existential conflict 
br   This was openly stated by Mr Erdogan who claims leadership in the Islamic world threatening war with complete destruction of the Jews the crusaders and all infidels  If you are not Muslim then you are definitely among the infidels who are subject to complete destruction  I am sure that you are aware of this and understand that this is not a slip of the tongue of an inexperienced politician  It39s time to stop turning a blind eye to the obvious  
br 
br                   There is a war of Islam against the WHOLE WORLD
br                  Israel simply found itself on the first line of defense 
br             Meet this    Islam and global jihad  WAR AGAINST ALL MANKIND
br 
brAllah has decided to destroy all the infidels and the unclean And he started with Hamas in Gaza Hezbollah and Iran prepare to accept the wrath of the Almighty

brBorrowed from a friend
brA little more history for those wanting to 39restore Palestine39
brIn 132 AD the Emperor Hadrian resolved to stamp the Jews and their religion out of existence He sold all Jewish prisoners into slavery after the revolt of Bar Kikhba forbade the teaching of the Torah renamed the province Syria Palaestina and changed Jerusalems name to Aelia Capitolina He renamed Israel to wipe out the national identity of Israel and the Jews
brSo if you are looking to 39restore Palestine to the Palestinians39 you need to give it back to the Jews
The forgetful presenter did not say that the Arabs once captured the entire Middle East and northern Africa with Fire and Sword destroying almost the entire male population of all countries She forgot to tell that after the end of WWII Britain and France as the victorious countries received instructions from the League of Nations to rebuild the defeated Ottoman Empire Both countries received Mandates from the League And new countries were created Iraq Bahrain Qatar Kuwait and others Under the Mandate for Palestine Britain was supposed to help create a Jewish state on the territory of the former Jewish statebrIn 136 AD The Romans expelled the unconquered Jews from their country They plundered the Temple and built the Colosseum in Rome And in the arena of this Colosseum they began to openly demonstrate their morals against which these rebellious Jews fought In the Colosseum arena men had sex with men and women with various animals including wild ones The cannibals chopped and tore each other into pieces devouring the defeated opponent for the amusement of the spectator And in order to further humiliate the Israelis they renamed the country Palestine which in Hebrew is consonant with plunderedbrIn WWI Britain was ready to enter into an alliance even with the devil in order to gain victory And after the victory having received the Mandate she farmed it out to one nomad brother  the bandit Iraq Other countries had already been formed Another nomadic brother a bandit began to make claims against Britain recalling to her his past merits Wanting to pay off Britain divides Mandatory Palestine into parts and gives 66 to a bandit  a sheikh This is how Transjordan appeared on the territory of Left Bank Israel With Hitler39s rise to power Britain issued a White Paper and based on humane considerations severely limited Jewish immigration  At the same time Britain made great efforts to drive Arabs from different countries to these desert landsbrThe remaining part of the Mandate was cut into separate unconnected pieces and given to the Jews These were mainly malarial swamps and waterless desertsbrJews fleeing pogroms and antiSemitism agreed to such a division But the Arab League an ally of Hitler did not even consider the possibility of providing asylum to Jewish refugees The Arabs were confident in their strength They have been acting by force for centuries and destroying everyone in their pathbrThis is how Muslims created the Beautiful Country  Pakistan at the cost of the lives of 60 million HindusbrThe Arabs attacked Israel immediately after the announcement of the creation of a new state In addition to the five surrounding countries three more countries sent their troops Leaving Israel Britain not only took away all the weapons but also declared an embargo on the supply of both weapons and food to the young country British officers with WWII and WWII experience led many Arab armies and divisions in the war against Israel All Arab countries in the region expelled the Jews most often with a bundle of things in their hands but sometimes without things In total the Arabs expelled about a million Jews Some went to South America Australia but more than 650000 were accepted and assimilated by Israel whose entire population then amounted to 650000 people And that39s not the whole story

You missed the point that Jews amp Christians lived in the land were already arabs as some of them converted for various religions you also didn39t mention the facial features between them and the European refugees came from Europe to colonize others
lol ppl and cartoonish explanations
Here you go not even a religiously biased video just pure historical facts of the Israelites inhabiting the land that belonged to them before the Palestinians and Muslims were even in existence
Nice white washed history Calling the nakba the Israeli Arab war is so ignorant it39s crazy
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvm19F4IHTVGcampt553913a you didnt mention WHY it was offensive Ariel Sharon was involved with the Qibya massacre where two thirds of the people were women and children killed Yes it was in response to an Israeli mother being killed with her children but first off did they bring a court case of it and second what justifies the right to massacre an entire village who didnt do anything to this woman This is why the second intifada happened he was no good man
JUST PEACE a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomshortspxEUbd3fzQhttpsyoutubecomshortspxEUbd3fzQsis4vKauBbz887KuLa
This is why religion is foolish Because blood is spilled over unprovable Fairy tales The UN just needs to declare that region neutral international territory If they cant learn to share then no one should have it
Lowkey just watched this cause people in my personal circle is boycotting American businesses for doing business with Israel and its so dumb to me cause its literally Israel taking back their home after surviving the holocaust
as they say from the mountain to the sea it will be 
The choice is simple for new generations of inhabitants of that region Do we want to focus on past conflicts and prolong the suffering Or do we want to focus on peace in the present and future If we choose to continue focusing on revenge or quotrighting past wrongsquot there is no hope for peace If we allow the past to remain in the past and focus on the fact that we all just want peace then there is hope going forward

Thank you for creating and sharing
I am Palestinian and let me summarize the issue for you with all honesty and impartiality
brThe short answer is that the conflict is religious first and ethnic second
brThe long answer is
brRegarding religion The Jews first the Christians second and the Muslims third consider it a holy land and the Savior will come from it etc That is why they will do anything to obtain it no matter how dirty the method is as long as it is analyzed in the Holy Books
brRegarding race Of course the superpower in the world is white and the Jews are of the same race and they will automatically defend them especially after Hitler did to them Of course like young children they will be allowed to do whatever they do
brNow if we ignore the religious and ethnic issue how do we know the conflict
brNow the Israelis say that they the people of the Jewish religion not the race have been living on this land for thousands of years and this region was called Israel but during the bloodfilled history of humanity they were expelled and somehow the Palestinians lived there at some point but certainly it is older than 1500 years Well I want each of you to think if every country thought like the Jews what would the state of the planet be like
brLook I do not blame the Israelis for invading the Holy Land and expelling killing destroying raping etc the population there because the history of humanity is based on conquest and colonization and the strong have the right to eat the weak because we live in a dark forest anyway but I really hate those who do not acknowledge their evil even though All humanity is evil
brA spark that ignites a piece of paper could burn down the entire house
br
brWhat do you think In all neutrality I just don39t want to hear anything related to religion or emotion at all just logic
br
brAdditional explanation of the conflict
brThe Jewish point of view
br  This is the land of our ancestors and God promised us it in our Holy Book and Hitler burned us so after this torment we have the right to possess the land that God promised us so that the Savior would come and save us because we are Gods chosen people and the race superior to all
brWe did not expel the residents or kill them but rather we only bought lands and we have proof of papers stamped by our loyal friend the United Kingdom
brOf course no one was displaced and no one was attacked The ones who started the war were the Arabs in their attempt to expel the immigrants from Gods land
brThe ones responsible for displacing the Palestinian people are the Arab armies on the basis that they will return to them later
brWe are the superior white people who built the earth from a barren desert to what it is now
brThere is no such thing as the Palestinian people and Palestine has no historical meaning
br
brThe Palestinian point of view
brJust simple residents who either live in agriculture or are under the mercy of British colonialism Suddenly the land was declared by British colonialism as a Jewish state in the name of Israel and everyone must leave it and whoever does not leave will be expelled by force
brThe Jews the Zionist movement expelled the Palestinians by force and the ensuing killing destruction rape etc
brThe United Nations and Britain support Israel and throw some crumbs to the Palestinians in order to preserve their standing before the world
brWe will not forget our land and we will return to it one day as we left it some families pass on the keys to their homes to each generation so that they do not forget their homeland
brIsrael is the reason for the suffering of immigrants
brIsrael is the greatest evil
br
brWorld view
brWho the hell cares Our problems are enough for us
br
brMy own point of view
brWell I39m just a simple human and my point of view will probably not matter to you Maybe if I had the power of Superman things would be different does kryptonite really exist Well maybe it39s better to choose the power of Saitama or Goku thinkingface thinkingface thinkingface 
This lesson starts late in the history of that land That land was already occupied At this point I would like to know who was there before and what occurred when the Israeli moved in
What can we expect from a people who have suffered almost 80 years of oppression and racism and whose lands are seized by the Zionists of course the resistance
brIsrael is therefore a victim of its victimspersonshrugging 
br   
Also before the israelites came to Caanan  there were alot of caananite tribes  Amorites  hivites  Girgashites  caananites  Perrizites  Jebusites and the hitties
There is no Palestine so there are no Palestinians There was a Palestine and the Palestinians were the Jews who lived there Being quotPalestinianquot is not a race ethnic nor religious group it is merely a geographic designation The Jews of Palestine were the only people who regularly referred to themselves as Palestinians and when people outside of Palestine referred to Palestinians they only meant the JewsHebrews Those quotPalestiniansquot changed the name of their bordered region to Israel in 1948 when they declared independence so now they are Israelis
br 
brThe people who are now referred to as quotPalestiniansquot may be arab so fine I agree they are arabs If you want to call them something call them NIMAs nonIsraeli muslim arabs But they are not Palestinians
br
brThe adoption of the term quotPalestinianquot by the nonIsraeli arabs who live in Gaza or the west bank cities was purely a public relations stunt to try and pretend that they have some claim to the land that exists west of the Jordan River They have no ancestral or racial connection to the people who coexisted on that land with the Hebrews of Judea and ancient Israel but thats a separate anthropological issue which is easily proven by any study of Middle East genetic anthropology
br 
brIf you dont want to believe me believe the muslim arab people themselves
br
brquotThere is no such country as Palestine  Palestine is a term the Zionists invented    Our country was for centuries part of Syria  Palestine is alien to usquot  Arab leader to British Peel Commission 1937
br
brquotThere is no such thing as Palestine in history absolutely notquot  Professor Philip Hitti Arab historian to AngloAmerican Committee of Inquiry 1946
br
brquotIt is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but southern Syriaquot  Delegate of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations Security Council 1956
br
brYes the existence of a separate Palestinian identity serves only tactical purposes The founding of a Palestinian state is a new tool in the continuing battle against Israel  Zuheir Muhsin late Military Department head of the PLO and member of its Executive Council Dutch daily Trouw March 1977
br
brIn February 2014 Sheikh Ahmad Adwan a Muslim scholar who lives in Jordan recognized Israels historic right to live in the Holy Land on his personal facebook page He wrote I say to those who distort their Lords book the Koran From where did you bring the name Palestine you liars you accursed when Allah has already named it The Holy Land and bequeathed it to the Children of Israel until the Day of Judgment the Sheikh stated
br
brSheik Adwan continued There is no such thing as 39Palestine39 in the Koran Your demand for the Land of Israel is a falsehood and it constitutes an attack on the Koran on the Jews and their land Therefore you wont succeed and Allah will fail you and humiliate you because Allah is the one who will protect them ie the Jews
br
brI39m a nativeAmerican because I was born in America but that doesn39t mean that I can make a legitimate claim to belonging to the Sioux or Cherokee or Maidu tribes To claim an ancestral right to land in New York so I can open a nativeAmerican gambling casino would be a fraud
br
brIf and when the nonIsraeli muslim arabs ever finally decide to create one or two independent nationstates out of Gaza and the nonIsraeli west bank cities the people will most likely not even use the term quotPalestinequot in their permanent country names Palestine is an English word based upon a Latin word used by the Romans to demean the conquered Judeans the Jews The Gazans and west bank arabs will ultimately do what the muslims of India did when their two nations were declared independent  they became Pakistan and Bangladesh Although the people are Indians they didn39t call their respective countries West India and EastWestern India They chose national names that are relevant to their personal real or imagined heritage Ceylon and Burma are two good examples of nonmuslim countries that followed this naming principal They changed the names of their countries to Sri Lanka and Myanmar respectively and became Sri Lankans and Myanmese 
br 
brFor muslim arabs to call themselves by a humiliating name selected by European infidels to demean Jews should and would be an embarrassment to them
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvm19F4IHTVGcampt192312a  you did not clarify how it became under their rule sykes picot agreement was a betrayal It should never have been under british rule period
Conviently igores various realities  The focus on Europe ignores the Jews from Arab lands that make up a large population of Israel after they were kicked out of those nations following the War of Independance  It also ignores the call by the Arab nations to flee the region during the 1948 war to avoid being caught in the crossfire  Similarly recommended actions by the Israelis during this conflict are called war crimes by those opposing Israel today  Finally the video acurately outlines the plans from the Oslo Accords but accuses Settlers of causing a problem for building in Area C
historyonmaps you have the wrong date for when Roman Empire renamed Judea and called it Palestine  that did not happen until 135 ADCE but you have the date as 63 BC  It was not until well after the death of Jesus Christ that the area was renamed Palestine  Otherwise seems pretty accurate but that date is totally wrong and you should correct it

Read in the Options Magazine that there are two kinds of solutions for any given problem One is the properly structured elegant solutions which is preferred by academics and the officialdom as this is their bread and butter  However at times these well structured solutions keep their elegancy but the problem is not addressed at all  The other is the clumsy solutions which lack a structure and elegance  However it has been proved that at times clumsy solutions  is the best  Here is one such clumsy solution for the bedevilled PalestinianIsraeli  problem 
br
brThe ongoing war in Palestine where Israel keeps pummeling Palestine has become a first rate tragedy for the whole world It is like a malignant tumor in the process of making not only the Middle East region but the whole body politic of the world to its death throes  In this developed world with AI and what not this malignant tumor has been festering for the past 100 or so years Is there no solution for this seemingly unsoluble tragedy  I as a citizen of the planet has spent a lot of time contemplating this sickness affecting the whole of humanity   This is the proposal in its may be simplistic nature The state of Israel could be statutorily dissolveddislocated   Do not take me wrong and I do not advocate the death of a single Israeli or Palestinian for that matter
br
brIsrael has about 8 million citizens  Suppose Israel supporting countries led by America which unequivocally support Israel paying a heavy diplomatic price for that support could take in about 2 Mn Israelis into America and so could large countries like Canada which a huge land mass but no populace Australia which is more or less the same Both these huge countries could take in say 1 Mn Israelis each  In the case of Germany it has a special a nexus with the world Jewry in part due to it Holocaustian past from which collective guilt still emanates  Germany took in l Mn Syrians in to their country and Syrians are different from Germanic races Not so Israel
br
brThere are other European countries like Portugal Italy England South Africa etel   How France another nexus laced with guilt as the Vichy Govtdeported a large cohort of Jews to crematoriums in Germany Now we are almost there Some could even find citizenship in North Korea should not be surprised at all Isralis could send rockets to space more efficiently unlike NK made ones which disintegrates in midair Russia which has a decreasing population problem could accommodate 1 Mn Israelis and send them to develop Siberia or revamp the Wagner cohort  Even Iceland could accommodate Isralei Jews and send the down to places where volcanoes erupt so as to deal with them 
br
brSo what of the now emptied state of Israel which is now no more Muslims all over the world would be salivating at that prospect and these lands could be turned over to the long suffering Palestinians who would be happy to reoccupy the lands they lost in the creation of Israel  I conclude and would be happy to elaborate re my brain child to anyone who is interested in a win win situation for all the stakeholders

Listen to the History channel allot do youneutralface 
this video sound very professional at the beginning but it has some glitches in recent historybrfirst of course is the 6 days war which was 6 and not 60 but then it start to take the arab nerrative  the 239d intifada supposedly started because ariel sharon visit to the holy places in Jerusalem only I know for a fact that the fighting started a month before that it was not acknowledged  but you can see Israeli soldiers killed a week and 2 weeks before  bralso  the retreet of Israel from Gaza was supposed to be the first step for the 2 states solution  Israel generously gave the Palestinians full control over the Gaza strip  even forcing Israelis to leave their homes which was freed of Egyptian occupation in 67  Gaza was given free country with all the option to start assuming the dream of free Palestine But as Hamas took charge it started to attack Israel and so Israel had to close the border to try to stop buying weapons  It was never a full blockade just for weapons but apparently as we see today a big failure as the Hamas succeeded in building  a monstrous infrastructure of tunnel with unbelievable amount of rockets and other ammunition brAnother inaccurate point is saying in 1948 the refugees were the natives residents of the land  some of them actually were but many were people that came to work in the prosperous Israeli parts of Palestine from neighboring countries many of the Muslim and Christian Palestinians stayed in their homes at 1948 and so they became citizens of Israel and kept their lands intact they are now more than 20 of Israelis citizens and are equal in all
Its ridiculous imagine if UK said all countries that once was in the british empires rule have to be returned to me its ridiculous houses get new homeowners and old owners are no longer owners and they cant just knock on the door and get the new homeowners out
Not a great video very one sided history here and the narrator mis pronounced almost every name of a place or person

gorvenance is a new spelling and why is he calling it the 60day war
Completely incorrect propaganda pushed by the Israeli lobby Israel is a settler colonial population founded in the ruins and bodies of the Palestinian land and nation
This ignores the Bajillion 2 state solutions offered to the Palestinians where Israel was willing to give them more land than they had for themselves and recognizes Palestine at times when it didn39t exist  but otherwise it39s very informative
People who say free Palestine i have to say israel had that land wayy before Palestine was a thing
In these paragraphs I will be going over my views and actual facts brI AM NOT INTENDING FOR THIS TO OFFEND ANYONE AND IF ANY HURTFUL THINGS ARE GOING TO BE COMMENTED DO NOT COMMENT THEM I AM WRITING THIS TO GIVE PEOPLE DIFFERENT VIEWS BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO COME INTO CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS OPEN MINDED AND PATIENTbrI did not cover everything that was talked about in this videobr First lets start with Quran Chapter 17 AlIsra ayahs 1 and 57brbr1 And we gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel saying 3939Take not other than me as your Wakil Protector Lord Disposer of your affairs 2 O offspring of those whom We carried in the ship with Nuh Noah Verily he was a grateful slave 3 And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture indeed you would do mischief in land twice and you will become tyrants and extremely arrogantbr 5 Then We gave you a return of victory over them And we helped you with wealth and children and made you more numerous in manpower 6 And We said 3939If you do good you do good for your ownselves3939 Then when the second promise came to pass We permitted your enemies to disgrace your faces and enter the mosque of Jerusalem as they had entered it before and to destroy with utter destruction all that fell into their hands 7 And We said in the Taurat Torah 3939It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you but if you return to sins We shall return to Our Punishment brbrbrYakub or Jacob was renamed to Israel which means one who prevails with God because he was faithful the Lord gave him this special name This chapter of the Quran is a very very clear warning to Yakub39s children the Children of Israel As I have seen on social media a lot of Israeli39s are proud about murdering the children As I have seen they have become very arrogant and ignorant brbrAnother group that is also apart of this history are the khazar39s people of Turkic descent who  in the 8th century according to textual witnesses accepted Judaism By the beginning of the 7th century the Khazar39s had become independent of the Turkic empire to the east But by the middle of that century the expanding empire of the Arabs had penetrated as far northward as the northern Caucasus and from then on until the mid8th century the Khazar39s engaged in a series of wars with the Arab empirebrbrWhen the Arabs and Islam was mentioned it felt like the view on them was slightly hateful but that39s just my opinion  brbrThe Ottoman empire was not an 3939Islamic superpower3939 It may feel like that because of the leader and the flag but it was never mentioned in the Quran and has nothing to do with Islam We should actually use white red green black and yellow which was mentioned in a hadith to represent Islam brbrMaybe just maybe the british people managing everything were maybe possibly slightly Islamophobic or didn39t like Arabs and they could39ve been more in favor of the Israeli people which made the Palestinians upsetbrbrI think the way parents also push things onto their kids can contribute to the hatred My school nurse told me that way way way back when she was in school they had such fear of the Russians and that they were going to bomb America They used to have drills where they would hide under their desks incase of an attack I know that growing up whenever I would see Jews anywhere I would always look at them differently and not really like them and I never knew whybrbrthere is so many more things I have to say but I keep losing my train of thought and I apologize for thatbrbrSince I have a lot of years ahead of me I should not be stressing about this but since I am aware of what39s happening I have a responsibility to share the knowledge I have I recommend that everyone reading this does research on the khazar39s and explores deeper into this subject I am against any lives being taken but was Israel is doing is simply unacceptable The things that are also coming out of the Israelis mouths39 are simply disgusting and it breaks my heart that we as a community can protest and fight against so many other things but a ton of people are staying silent about this Gaza is being wiped out as we speak with one side already being completely demolished We can no longer stay neutral in this situation and we must come together and help the Palestinian people I really really recommend checking out the instagram page Eye on Palestine The content they post really gives you a visual on what is happening in Palestine I hope everyone reading this has a blessed day FREE PALESTINEbr I AM NOT SAYING ALL ISRAELIS ARE BAD AND ALL PALESTINIANS ARE GOOD THESE ARE JUST MY THOUGHTS AND I TRULY BELIEVE IT39S JUST THE GOVERNMENT

How Israel was created Read the Bible And the LORD said to Abram after that Lot was separated from him Lift up now your eyes and look from the place where you are northward and southward and eastward and westward For all the land which you see to you will I give it and to your seed FOREVER Genesis 131415 God said this to Abraham in the 18th century bc In 1400 bc Joshua and the Jews moved into their land Jews have lived there ever since They were never completely eliminated from the land The Assyrians and the Babylonians took control of it then Cyrus the Persian allowed them to rebuild the temple which the Romans later destroyed The Romans scattered the Jews and emperor Hadrian renamed Israel Palestine 2000 years later they were allowed to go back to their own land and call it Israel That39s how Israel was created It was an act of God
It was the rothschilds that created israel

Israel belongs to the Jewish people it has been so for over 3 thousand yearsthe heading of this video should actually be quot How Palestine Was Createdquotthe info in this video is absolutely incorrectRead the history for yourself dates back to the roman Emporer Hadrid and other empires who tried to take over Israel and how many Jews were scattered around the world because of empires invading their land

I would agree that 1947 and 1948 were critical years but you39ve left out that Jews were massacred in those years as well The Palestinians did not and have not ever wanted a Jewish state The 1948 war was launched by 5 Arab states As far as a historical claim to the land the Roman  Jewish wars were fought on this land in the first century Jews have fought and lived on this land for a very long time

Thr jews killed british soldiersand niw were helping them disgracefull
Be aware this is propaganda not history There39s so much carefully left out And even mischaracterzes the territory as a country In fact the Arabs of the region who only started being called Palestinians in the 1960s for propaganda purposes didn39t consider themselves one nation and their allegiances were never to some nonexistent country called PalestinebrbrThey talk about reprisals but not the horrific massacres that brought thembrbrAnd quottheir historic homelandquot again pretends it was a countrybrbrIf it was such a vicious relentless ethnic cleansing how are there today two million Israeli Arabs

Concerning the white paper you skipped though with a few bombed places it was not a few it was The Irgun later the Lehi Militant Group aka the stern gang Wikipedia  who admitted  they were terrorists
not correct
What exactly were they fleeing from again
There39s something i don39t understand In the video he says palestinians all rejected UN39s plan to mark of 55 of the country for a jewish state but the zionist agree in order to get rid of the british So they went through with the plan without the acceptance of the palestinians
AlQuran explains everythingbrbrAl isra  4brquotAnd We warned the Children of Israel in the Scripture You will certainly cause corruption in the land twice and you will become extremely arrogantquot
we Somalis  Somalia   we stand with Palestine
So much fake misinformation in this video In 1948 the surrounding arab states invaded israel Israel didn39t start wiping out Palestinians as soon as the Brits left this is such a well documented event the Arabs didn39t accept the partition plan the Jews did
When your land have to give to jewish wtf
through lies Many places named after Israel true masters  The Rothschild39s
Nasty history of Britain that they want people to forget
but there were no palestinians then the arabs wanted a pan arab state and even today the arabs in refugee camps in jordan syria egypt etc who are called palestinian refugees are not supported by their arab friends whooh why bother
I love jews thank west for their existence brRunning organizations like open diaolog or open borders that brings and welxome all migrants also thank for fighiting against hate speach for us thank jewish
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6foH3Zc82ZQampt415655a Spoiler they didn39t because the Arabs rejected the offer and a Jewish state 20 of the population is Palestinians in Israel and experience rights as a normal Jew would Arabs weren39t forced to leave they left themselves Stop lying to yourself
So the Rothschild family bought a bad stock genocide Cant win them all I guess as Buffett said
How much did they get paid
AWESOME TRUTH crushed to the ground is risingbrbr This video sufficiently explains why modern day Israel is not Israel of the Bible brbrModern Day quotso called Israelquot was stolen from Palestine spearheaded by evil European looters and colonizers brbrI won39t even start on the raping of Africa brbrThanks for sharing your epic work hundredpoints hundredpoints brbrAnd as a Christian I do NOT stand with modern day fake Israel
The way Israel was created is the textbook example of how to wage an endless war
It wasn39t only the Jews immigrating to Palestine Under the British Mandate the Arab population of Palestine increased from 660000 in 1922 to 1300000 in 1947 much of which was economic immigration created by Jewish development brbrAnd yes it39s true that Jews had only acquired 8 of Palestine however Arabs also only owned 8 the rest was state lands
The real jews are of Jacob39s seed they are the negros from the tribe of Judah
I thought Britain or England was 7800 years oldbrnot 3100 years old
This makes me feel like the very ground under foot smells like death Its horrible to human life The solution now seems impossible Why that little strip of land and so much agony quotThe earth is but one country and mankind its citizensquotbrBaha39u39llah
The term quotPalestinequot gained prominence after the Roman Emperor Hadrian39s actions in the 2nd century CE After suppressing the Bar Kokhba revolt 132136 CE Hadrian renamed the region quotSyria Palaestinaquot as a way to erase Jewish identity and connection to the land The name was a reference to the Philistines ancient inhabitants of the coastal region
It39s unbelievable videos explaining about quotHow Israel was Createdquot don39t mention where the NAME Israel came from Nor tells who were the people who built the city Who were all the first several Kings in Israel and Don39t tell WHO were the INVADERS on that land  yepthe video above just tell the little tip of the iceberg and BTW the vid says the quotBritishquot did this but doesn39t EVEN mention why the British did that
This is by far the most inaccurate depiction of what really happened  There was no country of Palestine  This is full of lies and inaccurate information It is completely the leftist Arab view
Regarded as a Miracle development the creation of a Jewish state seemingly the one responsible is irrelevant
So Britain and the UN played a huge part in the conflict that is now today Israel and Palestine

During this period Jordan was carved out of Mandatory Palestine Pakistan was created with massive civilian losses in the millions and huge displacement of peoplebrSyriaIraqLebanon was carved out of the French Mandates And no outrage I wonder why Could it be Israel was the only and only Jewish State And based on Jews being such a minority in the world virtually impossible for them to be the majority anywhere when living under another groups Government
Sadly this video is flawed from the beginning by suggesting Palestine was a country as opposed to an area land controlled by various powers Most recently the Ottoman and then the British It was not a country There was no 39Palestinian leader39 And in general Jews called themselves Palestinian The local Muslim population identified as Arab until primarily 1964

bro just decided to edit history skull skull skull skull skull skull 
quotWhy were the British making promises about other peoples39 countriesquotbrbrPalestine had never been a sovereign nation in all of human history  It had only ever been part of larger empires  The last being the British  So it was theirs to do with as they pleased  The territory of Palestine ceased to exist in 1947
So in other words it39s too late to give Palestine back And we39re all forced to see the extinction of Palestinians and western governments just going to sit here and let it happen
Please start the story on the relationship between ottoman and palestine and its residents Just to know about the people of ancient roots and the people brought by the ottoman imperialism  It is obvious that there were no jews in palestine because they were chased off and scattered around the worldbrOtherwise this in only the story of balfour declaration and zionisims as solution for anti semitism the plan execution and effect

Cant believe this guy is just repeating raped women n babies killed by HAMAS while these claimed were not backed by evidence by the Israeli army n they themselves refuted the claims that they have no evidence of raped women n killed babies later onn the international television I mean comon wat are you feeding to the world  You are not listening n covering all the points This guy has not experienced wat Palestinians are going through to say that the ask them prior to evacuate these are automated msgs which sometimes reach or not and Things were worste for Palestinians even before HAMAS came into being so he is just talking crap here its obvious

So bro chose the countries where wars have been going on for a very long time so when the people of Palestine were being attacked for this many years it was not war and terror but when they were thinking to retaliate they were wrong but when Israel did it it is justified I am not taking any side I always vote for peace on both sides I don39t want innocent people to die and there are many videos of Israeli soldiers attacking mosques when people are praying when they give the taste of their own medicine it is wrong

The 39conflict39 goes back much further than tge British rule period
Historically brRomans named Israel PalestinebrThe true owner of that lsnd is Israel brHistorically
It was false to say that most Jews were not Zionists at any point just because they did not want to move to the ancestral land To be a zionist one simply has to acknowledge that the Jewish people have a right to self determination in their ancestral homeland I would submit that 99 of Jews at that time were Zionists
No word about  quot Amin alHusaini quot  this is a one side story
The British governments can never be trusted it was the same then and it39s the same today
This is a great summary from a British colonial perspective  I highly recommend both parts 1 amp 2
What everyone miss to mention is that Jordan was part of the british mandate for palestine so the arabs took 3 times more land than the jews actually the so called quotpalestinanquot arabs have a state since 1947 it is called Jordan it has the same flag as the quotpalestiniansquot are waving today the problem is and the heart of the conflict  that the palestinians dont want a jewish state in that region in any borders or shape quotfrom the river to the seaquot their famous chant makes that clear
Free Palestine  The Jewish people should have been resettled in their homeland in Khazaria
Please provide proof that Palestine was promised to the Arabs  The FaisalWeitzmann documents say otherwise The Jews were promised Palestine the Arabs were promised the rest of the land
This is by far the best coverage of the conflict I have seen so far Excellent
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfGH94HoSJ2sampt85125a wrong map for the Russian Empire in 1914bra hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfGH94HoSJ2sampt6591059a it39s pronounced Mesopotamia meaning quotbetween the riversquot not quotMesopotaniaquot

The conflict originated well before the times you speak of This war began with Abraham this is because he married an Egyptian slave named Hagar because his wife Sarah was barren Hagar bore him a son named Ishmael Later God made a covenant with Abraham and Sarah was able to conceive to him a son named Isaac God choose to continue the covenant with Isaac and Ishmael tried to kill Isaac when Ishmael was 17 and Isaac only 2 Sarah and Abraham cast out Hagar and Ishmael Ishmaels decendants are the islamists and Isaac39s decendants are the Jews You think we have more of a role in this than we do This war is because of polygamy and God said they would be at war until Jesus returns The prophecies are playing out still
Neither Palestine Mandate nor Balfour Declaration had any legal authority in England House of Lords ruled Zionism unlawful in 1922 It was dead in the water 1923 Ramsay MacDonald revived it in 1924 and it ran unlawfully through to 1948
The present conflict has nothing to do with the this It is about one thing The international community set up Israel And Israel has become one of the most successful and the only democratic countries in the middle east  Confluct is purely about the denial by Iran and it39s Proxies of the right of Israel to exist Nothing more
still dont get it
I39ll just remind us all the Trans Jordan Memorandum at the Cairo Conference of 1922 in which the Britts rulers of Palestine together with the Arab League States takes off the Eastern part of palestine know as Jordan today from the equation of the quotJewish Homeland in Palestinequot from the 1917 Balfour Dec
There was also an involvement from British Baptists in Zionism
Muslim arabs and Turks colonised the area after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire The Jews are the original inhabitants
Next explain Lebanon
So dont blame Israel Israel only accepted the solution
Semite does not just refer to Jews
Good information for the new generations and hope to see Palestine back on the map
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfGH94HoSJ2sampt77117a  Why does that say Mumbai  It should be Bombay
I am sure that the uprising involving Faisal also involved an obscure unknown British officer and his Rolls Royce armoured cars I am trying to remember his name but clearly I am not the only one to forget to mention T E Lawrence  quotof Arabiaquot
The fact that both Israelis and Arabs agree with this video shows how good it is
The British have so much to answer for Around the same time as Balfour the British were deploying the Black and Tans in Ireland to violently suppress the Irish population When Ireland violently removed the British they sent the Tans to Palestine to destroy people39s lives there How much sorrow has been created by British interference is too much to measures
The immigrant jews didn39t buy up the fertile land they bought malarial swamp land and agriculturally underdeveloped land which hadn39t been irrigated or maintained under Ottoman rule for decades and by modern western methods turned the area into a habitable land to which over the next few decades thousands of arabs migrated to from their own underdeveloped areas
Its a UN made disaster
Calling Palestinians muslim Arabs ignores the wealth of genetic evidence that Palestinians have indigenous DNA albeit with some Arab admixture They are culturally Arabs but calling them purely Arab delegitimises there connection to the land
Sure I have heard of the Balfour Declaration But until just now I had never had the chance to read what it actually says It strikes me that for such an important document it is surprisingly wishywashy to use the preferred academic termbrbrAs a official statement it simply expresses a preference It is not a law a foreign policy objective of the Crown or a carefully arrivedat negotiated treaty obligation39brIt simply seems to be a carefully worded straddle the fence thinking of the Foreign Office designed not to give too much away to either side designed to be abandoned or at least modified should shifting circumstances require itbrbrTo make it the cornerstone of British foreign policy is to quote Sir Bernard Appleby to put a burden on it that it is semantically and epistologically not designed to supportquot
The Ottomans were the failed colonial power that led to the British having to divide these lands up Why no blame resting on Turkey
So much suffering and pain for generations caused by the colonelist
I hope that part 2 will deal withbr1 Did the colonial powers have a right to do the division It is not addressed strongly enoughbr2 Was Palestine empty land and how does Asher Ginsbergs observations of Palestine in 1891 relate to this notionbr3 There were serious fights between Jewish settlers and native Arabs in Palestine throughout the 1930s It is glossed over thereby underplaying the beginnings of the illegal land claims of the Zionistsbr4 There were about 4 or 5 Zionist terror groups among them the father of Benjamin Netanyahu and Menachem Begin who famously claimed to be the original terr0ristbr5 Why was the Balfour Declaration addressed to Rothschild in particular and was that part of a deal to bring America in to support the British in the war This piece doesnt adequately deal with the background to the conflicting promises and why the Brits ultimately favoured the Zionistsbr6 This piece also does not adequately deal with the root cause of the current conflict the Zionists master plan of establishing Greater Israel It is the fulcrum of the manifesto of the Likud Party founded by BeginbrbrIt is a matter of emphasis and important to understand the degree of culpability of not just the British Empire but also those currently in power in Israel who continue to push the Greater Israel agenda
Doesn39t need a 15minute explanation to answer the questionbrbrI can do it in a secondbrYes
It39s a 2000 yr old issue 
i thought god promised land
The flippant drawing of borders were the Britishs specialty I wouldnt be surprised if they meticulously planned it this way
A story that needs to be told Thank you
The enemies news says it destroyed idf Why all over the news ga za is flattened and showing videos of crying Lies for sympathy
The Balfour agreement was never implemented the British handed over the mess they made over to the UN the UN set up Israel and Jordan from the British mandate
We are witnessing the beginning of the end of support for Israel The only way forward to a sustainable future for Israel is equal rights for all End the apartheid End Zionism
Yes and no It will soon be 100 years since the brits leftat some point the current inhabitants must be at faultI mean look at germany and france or france and england once death enemies but no more
Sadly most conflicts in history are British made
It was not a British made disaster It was events that you cannot control 
Britain  created trouble in all over the land they ruled Devideamp Rule was their motto Separated  Brunei  from Malaysia  KUWAIT  from IRAQ   created major conflict in Cyprus  in between  Greek amp Turkish speakers Seperated Sudanamp Egypt  India amp pakistan US  their foreign policy is  also devide and rule
Palestine belongs to Palestinians  brBritain had no right to hand over someone else39s land to a third party who then went about stealing even more Palestinian land and claiming some kind of Biblical right to it when they were mostly atheist Eastern European fleeing persecution by mostly Christian European people brBalfour himself was a rabid anti semite who closed the doors of the UK to European jewry with the illegal alien act brIsrael is an illegitimate state birthed in terrorism and ongoing genocide and the most heinous injustice still being perpetrated on the Palestinian people
Yes it is partially a British made disasterdriven by the stupidity of entering World War 1 in the first place and joining the struggle almost immediately
If you compare the treaties of Versailles the harshness of which is attributed to the rise of Hitler SaintGermain Trianon and Sevres it39s very easy to distinguish the extreme amount of racism inherent in the European mindset of the period Germany lost a minimum amount of land and Austria was disbanded to give the locals their own states while Turkey lost pretty much everything except a small portion of lowest value rural inner Anatolia and any nonChristian locals were instead colonized by Britain and France
Nothing about Arab massacres of the Jewish communities Odd
The more research i do the more i realize all these leftist kids really are just doing what they are told and have no idea the stuff they support
The problem that I have what give the British empire the right on the land of Palestine Especially give it to someone else
Britain you caused this mess Fix it
Very good and informative video  please do another part preferably more to cover whole history of Isreali state
Why don39t Western countries ever talk about how widespread antisemitism was in Europe before and during the time of Hitler How did they manage to brainwash today39s Jews into thinking that it was the Arabs who hated and discriminated against thembrbrWe must note that European Jews were the ones that had gone through holocaust The Middle Eastern Jews were not included in the onslaught by NAZIsbrbrThe Delusion of Thinking Themselves as Jews When some people of European and US descent converted to Jews their culture and beliefs not being themselves Middle Easterners were probably radicalized Thus they may practice adulterated type of Judaism or none at all for instance Zionists Hitler being radical felt repulsive against the Jews in the WestbrbrLet us delve back in history and note that the culture of religions in Europe and the Middle East were radicalized upon the formation and spread of Christianity by the ancient Roman empire Before this period the wars may also be overthrowing of old kingdoms with new ones but did not involved religion In fact when Cyrus ruled his Empire and other subjects he never imposed or mandated for a particular religion to strictly be followed although Zoroastrianism was widely practiced in PersiabrbrHowever during the era of Roman Empire Christianity was also aggressively spread to many other dominated countries Thereafter crusades began to invade and grab lands of both Jews and Muslims Lots of genocide were involved in the process Thus the crusades were forerunners of Christian zionismbrbrToday it is Israel zionism that invade and grab lands in the Middle East It is Israel with the support of US that commit genocide What is interesting is that these modern Zionist Jews originally came from Europe and they do not strictly observe Judaism they are not even dark skin to be considered as Middle EasternerbrbrWe have take into account how radical the empires of Europe and currently the US What may be referred radical about these empires They are idealists in dealing with their own political power religion Christianity ideologies democracy or communism They push to expand their beliefs as imperialists Thus it is no wonder there always exist blood and war in their hands

The IsraeliPalestinian real Muslim conflict isn39t about land it is a clash of a primitive 7th century world view and modern technological liberal democracy Islam cannot survive in a modern context so it has no choice but to oppose that context This conflict won39t go away even if they manage to destroy Israel This conflict is an existential necessity for Islam which means it is an existential threat to the rest of us

Because no one had fought over the Holy Land before Britain meddled
When will the west stop patronising the Arabs and see them accountable to their own actions
You spelt Ottoman Empire39s fault wrong
No
Israel region was peaceful for 400 odd years of muslim rule then brits come along
The Arabs got two states based on their claim that they were a homogenous people the Jews got one state based on their historic connection to the land of Israel or Palestine as the British called the holy land This became part of international law via treaty Sevres Balfour declaration was meaningless until it became part of the treaty of Sevresarticle 95
What the British seems to be doing when they gave up the colonies is to sow the seeds of future internal strife and conflicts

Wow lets start the antiBritish comments on here shall we brYes the British empire wasnt perfect but neither was any empire over human history like the Aztec Japanese Roman Ottoman Zulu Mongal Inca Chinese dynasties etc etcbrRegardless of what the British colonial office planed out the Arabs and the Jewish people would still be fighting Humans have been fighting for thousands of years even natives were in conflict with each other way before colonialism by the various empires came to colonise Religion Politics and Wealth is the route of all evil and destruction We today judge the past on both a high morality and hindsight just like future generations will just us today for the derisions and mistakes of today
No
Thanks Britain
Don39t blame us It39 s the Americans39 fault  Seems reasonable
Yep its disaster Look at it now
The context is that it wasn39t just the Arabs of Palestine  but the same Arab nationalism was everywhere Britain and France were fighting rebellions in Egypt Iraq and Syria   The statistics are kind of sus Jewish immigrants were much more likely to be documented by British officials  while Arabs would not   This would skew the numbers esp if their extrapolation presumption of the population were inaccurate  In 3948 Arabs still had a strong majority of the population
A clear informational video that shows the history of the region Looking forward to part two

Firstly  The Levant has been the scene of wars for the last 4000 years primarily because of its location which is never going to change War there is not the result of historically recent events but caused by many other factors brSecondly it was the British who were largely responsible for getting various Arab peoples around the table to negotiate a solution to the many conflicting interests in the Middle East and those peoples are as much a part of the problem as the agreement they signed up to brThirdly it was known at the time that the agreement was not going to be a permanent solution None of the signatories were entirely happy with it but accepted that it was necessary in order to prevent chaos in the area brFinding a solution that all parties would be happy with is virtually impossible given that none of the peoples in the Middle East seem content to live in peace with their neighbours so to simply blame the British is disingenuous
They don39t call the Union Jack a Butchers Apron for nothing hey
Basicallypalestine had a choice in 1947 Except the 2 state deal or not They chose not to attacked israel lost and lost most of the land they would have had Not a smart move by palestine leaders You could say there leaders have been garbage since the 1940s
So the British will clean up their mess and all will be wellbrMaybe a single secular state called Balfouria would work
Accordingly Britain committed the first clear evident genocide against Palestinians 17 1 in 6 of male population 
So the Turks had subjugated most of the Middle East into the Ottoman Empire When the British amp Commonwealth allies drove the Turks out of the Middle East amp back to their own borders they then had to negotiate with the various Arab groups to decide who owned what land after the Turkey had occupied for over a 600 years Added to that were the varied interests of France amp the USA primarly for oil rights in these areas The USA held the UK to the Balfour Agreement as did France amp consequently the UK had to balance the geographical situation in order to get a peaceful solution This was achieved amp everyone was happy However on the advent of WW2 The Germans actively encouraged the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to call on all ArabsMuslims to wage a Holy War against the French Italian amp British The then Grand Mufti was a Palestinian Arab who was against a Jewish State in Palestine  After serving in the Turkish Army in WW1 he was appointed by the Ottoman Empire as Jerusalems Grand Mufti or Leader of the Muslims in the Middle East This appointment was ratified by the British in 1936 but a warrant was issued for his arrest after he instigated a revolt against British rule in Palestine after which he fled to Nazi Germany He subsequently used his influence to incite anti British feelings hoping that Germany would conquer the Middle East with his help amp establish a Palestine State After the War he returned to Lebonan under French protection amp began to form a Holy League against the Jews which eventually morphed into the Palestine Liberation Organisation whose offshoots are Hamas amp Hezbollah It39s easy amp convenient plus traditional it seems to blame previous UK Governments for the situation in the Middle East But these blamers amp finger pointers neglect to factor in the Oil companies who had amp still have such an influence in Middle Eastern countries Bear in mind that the majority of these oil companies are American Now review your anti British opinions about the current Middle East situation amp perhaps you39ll come to a different conclusion as to who is ultimately responsible for the current ongoing conflicts in that part of the world

I think its funny how jews always destroyed and mamed land but all other religions rebuild wherever they go
Hashemite were arabs from mecca Arabia  so it were more like imperial aspirations than nationalist aspirations in other words replacing ottoman empire with Hashemite empire
The problem is Balfour and Rothchild decided to make a Jewish state when the land was pretty empty although under Ottoman control and dominated by arabs By 1946 the land was a lot fuller from immigrantsarab and jewish The arabs expected the land to be given to them considering they had been the majority population for a very long time under Ottoman rule The Brits were under pressure to make a decision and end their colonial rule which made them pass the decision over to the UN I think the Jewish people deserve land of their own but the arabs were the majority people The arabs were already angry at immigration The most peaceful method would have been to give the land to the arabs

This is a simple subject Its all traced to Israels ethnic cleaning of Palestinians from their homes and land and the subsequent apartheid system Israel set up to push out or subjugate the Palestinians This is in addition to planned repression and brutality as well as laws that prevent the Palestinians from growing as family units and as neighborhoods Thats why Israel not only massacred Palestinians before the state of Israel was founded but after as well And add to that the periodic assaults on various villages massacring the inhabitants but also letting and helping settlers kill and terrorize the Palestinians brbrIts been a criminal enterprise since before the state of Israel was founded Israel has lost its right to be a nation with its repeated crimes against humanity since its founding and its flagrant and repeated violations of international law and the Geneva conventions
This video is biased Israel existed 2000 years ago Romans named Judea quotPalestinequot
The British may have stoleraped and massacred their way to a world globeshowingAmericas  empire But they weren39t the first or the last Being no better or worse than any other people Human with all the gifts and flaws that brings
This documentary keeps on talking as if Palestine was a country well established with a president or so  It was a piece of land where different ethnic groups of people lived there beside Arabs
What I concluded is that Palestine sought for an Independent State when and only because the Jewish people wanted a State for Israel
Still does not explain general Islamic hate for everybody and their terrorism
israel pulled a 911 killed their own people to try and justify the conquest of gaza
This was slanted against the Jews and was proPalestine
WTF with all the blurring in this video
Timely video Enjoyed the content and historic perspective on the ongoing conflict between the Palestinian and Israeli people I hope they will be able to find a solution so the hatred and killing ends Concessions will be required on both sides I think and an outside arbitrator will be key in my opinion
What started the conflict today is the inhumane treatment of the Palestinians and the Jewish influence in the United States Government
There of generalizations and bias in this documentary
Completely ignores and even downplays the horrors that Muslims have put Jews through since the 7th century This conflict didn39t start in the 190039s it started in the 60039s Put simply if all the Jews in Israel converted to Islam today the conflict would be over no one would talk about quotPalestiniansquot or quotPalestinequot again except as a footnote in history

The premise is incorrect  The League of Nations approved the Jewish state in Palestine  All of the quotit39s all about broken British promisesquot is propaganda   The Arabs were well aware of the decisions that were being made by the Allied Nations who won the war and received title over Ottoman territory by treaty
Thanks to the program designer for not covering up the end of the show with those dang prompts for the next program though minimized it did not block the last speaker I know trivial but for me it makes the staying to the end so enjoyable
White European and American land thieves PRETENDING to be Israeli is the root of the problem
The jews wanted a country for themselves to scape persecution and achieved it by mass migration and land purchases which are peaceful means In that sense I can only congrutulate them The arabs had nothing to fear for lives and property but didn39t want the presence of a bunch of new people whith different looks tongues and religions to their and set to give their identity to the state It39s really nothing different from the anxieties many Europeans feel about mass arab migration and I don39t blame them In the end both had valid points
I39ve been watching documentaries on Middle Eastern and Southern Asian countries recently and somehow whenever the documentary refers to the root of the conflictgenocidewhatnot the quothonourable mentionquot almost always goes to Britain that  in some way managed to f up something neutralface

According to google39s bard ai brbrThe Canaanites were an ancient civilization that lived in the region known as Canaan roughly corresponding to modernday Israel Palestine Lebanon parts of Syria and Jordan Their peak flourished during the Bronze Age specifically the Late Bronze Age 15501200 BCE
br
brHere39s a breakdown of their key aspects
br
brWho
br
brNot a single unified group While referred to as quotCanaanitesquot they likely comprised various ethnicities and citystates with diverse cultural nuances
brSemiticspeaking Their language belonged to the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family similar to ancient Hebrew and Aramaic
brSeafaring and trading Skilled seafarers and traders they established numerous ports and coastal cities that thrived on commerce
brPolytheistic Worshipped a pantheon of gods and goddesses including Baal El Asherah and Anath
brbrWhere
br
brCentered on the eastern Mediterranean Their territory mainly encompassed the lands along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea from Lebanon in the north to the Sinai Peninsula in the south
brUrbanized Lived in numerous citystates and towns some famous examples being Ugarit Megiddo Jericho and Jerusalem
brFarming and trade Practiced agriculture and animal husbandry while maritime trade played a vital role in their economy
brbrLegacy
br
brCultural influence Their language art and religious practices exerted significant influence on neighboring cultures including the Israelites
brArchaeological insights Excavations of Canaanite cities and artifacts offer valuable clues about their daily life economy and beliefs
brBiblical connection The Hebrew Bible frequently mentions the Canaanites portraying them as rivals or enemies of the Israelites
I still support the right of the Jews to have their own country YET you take Palestine you take the Kashmir issue  just any lingering problem around the world is due to British DIVIDE amp RULE POLICY Confound the British their machinations amp dirty minds
The Israelies are arrogant and self obsessed ignorant
It39s a religion not a country

here is an answer  terrorist attacks what else did you really think that if you gas lighted the issue that people would forget and no it was not one person who created this issue it was the meddling of the west and the need t control the entire world

OilbrThe new discoveries of oil and natural gas in the Levant Basin amounting to 122 trillion cubic feet of natural gas at a net value of 453 billion in 2017 prices and 17 billion barrels of recoverable oil at a net value of about 71 billion offer an opportunity to distribute and share a total of about 524 billion among the different parties in addition to the many intangible but substantive advantages of energy security and cooperation among longtime belligerents They can also potentially be a source of additional conflict and violence if individual parties exploit these resources without due regard for the fair share of others What could be a source of wealth and opportunities could prove disastrous if this common resource is exploited individually and exclusively without due regard for international law and norms

I just watched this documentary under a different title
Many of the facts in this video are really up to who is telling the story The land called Palestine once referred to the people living there which included Christians Arabs and Jews Yes at one time before the Israeli state was formed Jewish people living in the land of Palestine were referred to as Palestinians Same for Christians and Arabs  One could also argue the issue between the Arabs and Jews goes much farther back into ancient history as described in the Bible
Britain subordinating all residents in Middle East to   interests of the empire Bet 1 percent of the world watching know how much this is the product of the British Empire
TEAM ISRAEL
That land was Judea long before the Romans called it Palestine as punishment for revolt
To create the State of Israel Zionist forces attacked major Palestinian cities and destroyed some 530 villages Approximately 13000 Palestinians were killed in 1948 with more than 750000 expelled from their homes and becoming refugees  the climax of the Zionist movement39s ethnic cleansing of Palestine It is called Nakba catastrophe  Since its creation it has always been practiced ethnic cleansing until this day Zionist Israel never wants 2 state resolutions
It baffles me that many minorities who are openly supporting Hamas a terrorist network whose sole objective is to slaughter the Jews of the earth and destroy the State of Israel are supporting a movement that would easily throw them off a building in a heartbeat once they stepped into Gaza brbrIf you think youd be safer in Gaza as a homosexual than in Tel Aviv youre a fool
So every single conquering army over the last 2000 years that arrived with sword in hand slaughtered the inhabitants and seized the territory have no culpability But when the British and French arrive create sovereign Arab nations and leave the violence is all their fault Multiculturalism for White people only I guess
Now look what39s happening to England It39s all about greed
Let39s be honest  This has been going on for longer than the last few centuries  If you are of the Abrahamic faith it began with Isaac and Esau  If not I offer other evidence  They built the dome of the rock on top of the temple mount holy to judaism in the 7th century
When western world has rich jews from Europe to others why does USA has to pay package of such huge sum of notes to Israel why not other nations And same to Ukraine I mean somewhere you have to think note and understand what is going on behind this facade
It39s depressing but I have to watch The little knowledge I do have keeps me from taking sides The more I learn about this topic the less hope I have for what lies ahead
So The main culprit for this unfathmoble mess is BritainbrbrThey must stand much more to their historic responsibility

Another great video
sorry but you have many errors in your report The peace process between Arafat and Rabin was not stopped by Hamas
watching this after the red sea crisis Well predicted sir
This is vastly incomplete Hamas attacked because Gaza is under occupation by Israel They are a resistance movement This started in 1948 not the 1990s facewithrollingeyes  Also Izzy created and was previously funding Hummus to weaken the PLO and prevent a Palestinian state
Dark things are going on over that part of the world
As in the documentary shown in the video in a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcT93a0ENcqgampt390630a Israeli occupation made the unemployment rate skyrocket
This history lesson is actually quite biased
This video is nowhere close to reality It is bits and pieces of what has truly been happening on the ground You should acknowledge the indigenous people and the country before 1947 The British mandate granted Zionist Jews the right to establish a nationhood on the land of the indigenous Palestine The 1948 was actually called the year of Nakba Catastrophe when Jewish Zionists alongside support of Britain invaded Palestine mass murdered and forced ethnic cleansing of over 500000 Palestinians In 1920s Palestine was home to Christians Jews and Muslims but with the British mandate Jewish Zionists had been fleeing into the country and causing chaos Meanwhile today Hamas does not control Gaza Israel has placed a siege on Gaza in 2006 not to mention that Gaza was mainly refugee camps ethnically cleansed Palestinians by Israel Gaza is under the biggest open prison in the world and since 2006 Israels siege on Gaza Israel has only been allowing 20 of goods that used to enter pre2006 Did you know that in 2016 Israel banned chocolate wedding dresses and even coriander amongst other goods Help me understand how wedding dresses are used to make weapons Or coriander brbrStop this propaganda and educate yourself properly on the matter Pick a book and read about this conflict beyond the surface because as of today Israel has killed over 30000 Palestinians and dropped over 30000 tons of explosives thats the equivalent of 2x of the Hiroshima bomb So educate yourself before you confirm or take a stance No war justifies the targeting of civilians mainly children This is a genocide on children
Its not a war its freaking occupation Simple and clear
Liar rollingonthefloorlaughing 
You missed one point isreal is occupying west Bank
Balfour declaration 1948 started it In Palestine all three religions lived there peacefully until this event Lord Balfour handed to Lord Rothschild the Palestinian land which was under the British mandate at that time like many countries worldwide were at that time Indian had gotten independence only a year before that
Good analysis but you keep making the assumption that normalisation with israel  peace which is simply not true  not if we consider the atrocities that israel commits against Palestinians in their own land In fact normalisation especially of Saudi with israel would serve as a validation for israel to continue its occupation and human rights violations in Gaza and the West Bank
This video was helpful in understanding how it could affect Indian
I was with you until you blamed the October 7th attack on Iran a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcT93a0ENcqgampt7721252a let39s stop spreading fake news This claim has already been debunked not only by the Iranians but also by the Americans
The accent omg
Elections were held in 2006  Hamas was encouraged to participate by the US and Israel It was supervised by Jimmy Carter and declared to be free and fair Hamas was not expected to win It won the elections  there was a civil war between Hamas and the PLO and Hamas got control of Gaza while the PlO got control of the West Bank  A  coup attempt failed to oust Hamas and Hamas was declared a terrorist organization by the US and Israel and a blockade was implemented Nothing goes into Gaza and nothing comes  out except with  special permissions and very rare to get it The area is 5 miles by 25 miles and has 24 million people with half being children Israel controls air space the sea  water food  calories are calculated per person to be just above starvation fuel medicines of Gaza They have severe food insecurity as per UN  70 percent of people are displaced people from the 1948 nakba There is very high unemployment From time to time there have been many Israeli military operations referred to as  mowing the lawn to control Hamas
The world39s monopoly of war Israel army versus Palestian civilian
We must free palestine
We mist go help palestine
Its not a conflict it us a Genocide of Palestinian muslims
Isreal has no right to defend itself against the Occupied resistance

Bogus facts thumbsdown facevomiting

And India is trying to take advantage for aupporting US and Israel Lol
I urge muslim countries take Biden and  Netanyahu as war criminals

according to the united nationPalestinians have right to armed struggle against Israeli occupiersso hamas can39t be called terrorists
according to the united nationPalestinians have right to armed struggle against Israeli occupiersso hamas can39t be called terrorists

Israel was oppressing Palestinians for many years What was that Shouldn39t we call him terrorist attack 
The world need trump to make peace
Background and facts
brrightarrow  After the Nakba 750000 Palestinians were forced to leave their homes 
brrightarrow  78 of Palestine was captured the remaining 22 became West Bank amp Gaza
brrightarrow  The West Bank has over 700000 illegal Israeli settlers UN report
brrightarrow  In the past 15 years 6407 Palestinians and 308 Israelis were killed 
brrightarrow  75 years of oppression has made 59 million Palestinian refugees 
brrightarrow  Israel is committing apartheid Amnesty International
brrightarrow  Gaza Israels OpenAir Prison Human Rights Watch 
brrightarrow  There are 65 Israeli laws that make Palestinians 2nd class citizens 
brrightarrow  Israel has arrested around 17000 women amp girls and 50000 children since 1967
During the Oslo Israel gained control over 60 of the West Bank land and its water resources and implemented electric fences amp walls to divide Palestine So it39s wasn39t a peace treaty

Trade route being built from India through the ME and the meltdown area to EU
Hy Ganesh sir In every election you made video about the development of that state work of governmentbrWhy not with MPcryingface 
Correction Israel only wants peace if they can remove the Palestinians from West Bank and Gaza Strip They are on the cusps of achieving full take over of the West Bank removing the Palestinians
Correction US intentions is not about making peace but merely to divide and conquer True peace starts with Iran and Saudi Arabia and Israel Not some smaller Nation That is why China Made peace in 2023 between Saudi Arabia and Iran
Correction Iran is not the main contributor to Hamas it is Qatar and Hamas was created by Israel to destroy the PLO Thirdly after WW2 the problem started when Israel killed 750000 Palestines while starting to take away the West Bank Look at historical maps showing the changes from 1947 to today You need to have the historical context correct
Israel is like our Indian neighbors who keeps on extending their territory

Although I am in support of Israel but America is playing it39s cards well  not bad cryingface 
Sir thank you for your video but you got so much wrong in regards to the Palestine and isreal wars  In particular you forgot to mention that isreal was never a country until 1948 when the UK government at the end of the Second World War gave Palestines country to Jewish people against the rights of the Palestine people The Jewish people immediately went on a murdering campaign using weapons the uk gave them driving palestine people out of the farms and cities and took over the country  Palestine people became refugees in their own country  Finally under president Clinton the Palestines and Isreal prime ministers made a truce and agreed that pale stone would be given back some of their land and be their own state again  Unfortunately a zealot Jew who was unhappy with the Isreal prime minister signing this truce assassinated that Isreal prime minister and Netanyahu took over the leadership in isreal Netanyahu refused to accept the truce signed by the assassinated  prime minister and denied the Palestines right to have some land back and be their own state  Since the the Netanyahu government have fenced Palestine people into two areas of the country and heavily policed them including doing what Netanyahu calls mowing the grass This just means he has the military bomb them every so often to keep them under control In the Gaza Strip Palestine people are not free to come and go Its the largest open air prison on the planet  If anyone leaves without seeking government permission they are killed  Just like any prison isreal controls everything that comes into the prison including food water and electricity  They can cut these off anytime as they have done recently Some historians researching Gaza have shown that the Israel government carefully measures food coming in so that people are just above the starving line  The Hamas formed and was actually encouraged and helped by the Netanyahu government They felt that if Hamas was in place in opposition to the mild mannered Palestine government then the Palestine would begin fighting amongst themselves and this would leave them less time to fight against their oppressors Israel That did not work  Hamas ended up in leadership over the Gaza Strip and the Palestine government remained the government of the West bank Although neither were true governments as Palestine people are not recognised as citizens of Israel and the country Palestine ceased to exist when the Israels took over in one of the bloodiest wars there in 1948  At the time of the recent uprising by Hamas Netanyahu was in deep trouble with his people He had been charged with several crimes of corruption and should have been in jail but he used his position to change the laws in the country which saved him and in the months leading up to this attack by hamas Isreal people were marching daily calling for his sacking  He actually was so stressed by this he has a heart issue in September and needed a heart pacer  The Gaza Strip is the most surveilled area on the planet and some say it would be impossible for hamas to have broken through the fence and run riot for more than 5 minutes before attack helicopters would be there to stop them  Despite is they run amok for more then 7 hours with military intervention  Ask yourself how that can be so Recently a young man who was an Israel and patrolled that part of the strip says he think this was a inside job a false flag done to save Netanyahu in his time of political crisis  This young man even claims that in late September the Israel army ordered the removal of all the weapons from the guards of the Gaza Strip  I think this event may well be more compteed than we think but for now we have Israel carpet bombing heavily populated areas of civilians killing a child every 15 minutes inside a tiny area which is a prison and where civilians cannot escape even if they wanted to

If Hamas attacked Israel and got support by Iran which is surely true why Israel did not attack Iran or Hamas back why it started attacking Palestinians the only reason is it wants to make Jerusalem its capital so it could make its temple if I am wrong go and check for Jerusalem and as we all know that it is not the capital of Israel  which is clearly written in the Holy Quran stop marketing your side by saying it is right people maybe i am wrong but please read it on your own don39t trust anyone39s case studies I think this case study should be about shaking the world economy but it is all about Hamas and Iran partnership and making Israel a victim which is not true

I am surprised by the Indian people for standing by Israel but in the past they suffered the same hardship as the Palestinian people during the time of the East India Company when it occupied their country and when the Indians were defending their country the world described them as savages but I always said that the Indian people have the right to defend their country but after Over time this same people abandoned the truth that Israel occupied Palestine for 75 years and until now just as the East India Company occupied India for many years so why do you side with the bad ones

You mean Hamas police officers facewithrollingeyes 
Holocaust of Muslims in Palestine is continue support of Western world and Western media
It is indeed terrible what the Palestinians are going through What Hamas is doing to them is terrible and terrible There is no contradiction between supporting the Palestinian people and understanding the Israeli side that is simply reacting to the murder and rape of civilians And for Palestinians to stop dying maybe Hamas should stop using them as human shields It will help

The hatred for Jews is insane We dont hear about Syria Yemen or any other place where Muslims are killing Muslims in far greater numbers But soon as the Jews kill a Muslim then the world is supposed to care They elected Hamas and brought this on themselves
Majority muslim countries like Iran Iraq Pakistan Bangladesh Afghanistan Libya Sudan Somalia Yemen Syria Egypt are all backward and dysfunctional thanks to is lam They all harbor terrorists and are in constant  violent conflict within themselves and their neighbors
This Iranian foreign minister always talking the language of the end of Israel and Netanyahu redline and he doesn39t feel a shame while his country losing many generals and commanders in Syria Gaza Yemen and hizbollah they are killing young boys just for payment of 700 US

Religion racism and nationalism are the true evils fuelling this conflict
The rafah crossing is controlled by Egypt not Israel
The British always messed up a country with psychological warfare inciting hate and violence  Sounds like Trump
If you read Hamas charter and then you realize the Gazan people voted for violence
When British draw borders their intention is not to make it a closed territory but fight for ages
one sided story
The question at this point is which media house is telling the truth

This is discusting  I stand with Palestine PalestinianTerritories 
Dam I feel bad for Palestine
Finally a video about IsraelHamas war that dont have people that comment Free Palestine
Oh brother I can39t go 30 seconds without coming across some gravd factual inaccuracy Israel in 67 did NOT launch an attack on Jordan or Syria out of fear of being attacked Israel launched an attack because they WERE attacked first by those two countries Egypt js the only country Israel preemptively struck
The surrounding Arab countries did not declare war on Israel because of the influx of refugees Their genocidal intentions towards the Jewish settlements were made known well before the UN declared the state of Israel
No it is NOT Israel that exclusively controls the borders with Gaza The entire souther border is shared with Egypt Singling out the Jews for the seige and ignoring Egypt and recognizing that if both an Arab and Jewish state agree on the need for such a seige then perhaps there is some military necessity for it is antisemitic
It doesn39t matter who is the real bad guy The conflict is awful and both sides are suffering

Wow theyre both being let down by their own governments What a surprise
So full of misguided information
I mean dont attack them if you dont want your citizens to get hurt
And total ignore about the border with Egypt their quotbrothersquot gosh
this will still be a thing in year 3034
Strange not to see one rocket fired from Gaza landing in Israel or an explanation as to why the border with Egypt is also closed Seems like they are deliberately trying to mislead people which I can only assume is politically motivated I think if we could first be honest we may find peace
It sold that Hamas are a terrorist organisation but Israel have limited the lives of the people in Gaza its no wonder that they will rise up and fight
Hmm I wonder why would the evil Jewish State start to quotforcibly expell hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their land to establish the state of Israelquot in 1940s I can only imagine the shock of people living in the peaceful Arab State when those unexpected Jewish attacks have started Another interesting historic fact covered in this video is the only war in the history of humanity caused by countries being quotoverwhelmed by refugeesquot My only hope is that European leaders will not declare war against Ukraine after watching this
this is very one sided
This all stems from colonialism  religion and greed If we didnt have religion we would be much more peaceful
So its basically district 12

This Channel is funded by HAMAS
Is this a one sided video Yes
The problem with a possible solution to this conflict is the Palestinian opposition to the very existence of Jews and Israel If they are freed completely they will try to wipe out the Jews immediately that leaves nothing to negotiate for The world can just sit n watch with no solution to this generic hatred in sight
Its disturbing how Gaza is pretty much a failing fallout shelter vault at this point 
All the comments are being filtered YouTube is starting to act like big brother
This is literally the most sympathetic video towards Palestinians It doesnt cover as much as it should The full history
Probably one of the worst Vox videos Ive seen so far  In the past their Explained series generally used to be more detailed amp fairly objective  However in my opinion at least this largely just comes off as an antiIsraeli proPalestinian compassion piece  brbrThats not to say that their research in this video is wrong or that Israel is not to blame for anything but way too much contextual information has either been left out or glossed overbrbrAlso failed to mention how over the course of time Palestinian extremist groups including Hamas amp the PLO have entered or claimed refuge within Arab countries such as Lebanon Jordan Kuwait amp Iraq  They then aligned themselves with rebellion movements amp startedsupported multiple destabilising uprisings within their Arab neighbours borders  brbrProbably worth mentioning just one reason why Egypt amp co are refusing to accept any refugees in this latest crisis
yeah leave it to arabs to tell you history lol
This is a very unbalanced view of events
So basically theyre Muslim neighbors dont want them either got it
Half truth is worse than a lie You really disappointed Vox this time You missed plenty of important details Shame
I don39t know seemed like pretty fair reporting to meSaid no one
Pray for Palestine PalestinianTerritories 
Should have covered pre2006 Israeli factors that influenced Hamas growth
This is a very partial report it leaves out important parts of history and skews the facts  For example the expulsion of Palestinians came after the Arab Invasion in 1948 not before and Israels attack on Egypt came as a preemptive strike after Nasser gathered thousands of troops on Israels border
And people still say this isn39t an apartheid state manfacepalming 
Palestine rejected Britains suggestion for two state solution   Palestine wants Jewish genocide
My honest question is why are Gaza people dependent on Israel for food electricity clean water basically essentials
AlSisi is guilty AlSisi is a criminal with all the descriptions of crime he and his cowardly regime which not a day goes by without God humiliating them and disgracing them and the last disgrace is here today coming from the International Tribunal in The Hague Yes it is true that AlSisi is the one who closes the Rafah crossing and starves an entire people AlSisi and I will explain and confirm my words Ok AlSisi was not the one who closed the Refaa crossing and it was the entity that was deliberately accusing him of this charge Ok Sisi O Khasisi stand up now and do the opposite Open the crossing and let the aid pass If not as you claim are you not the one closing the crossing The entitys words and if this entity is something we do not trust then its words and accusations against Sisi and his regime are completely true because Sisi will not open the crossing even though the entity accuses him of closing it and this is exactly what proves that Sisi is actually the one closing the crossing
Gazans are basically Egyptian
Hold up Israel is older than Palestine Rome named Palestine
Israel has not occupied Gaza since 2005

This video is totally proPalestine They are saying militant bombings and Palestinian attacks in a casual manner But when Israel is doing something then they are saying it with emphasis Palestinians gave Israel no option Whenever Israel is trying to have peace they are committing terrorism What is Israel supposed to do in this situation Why should it sacrifice itself for Palestinians Also Hamas is using children as human shields and forcibly keeping them at places which have been issued warning by Israel Just try to look at the actual picture of what is really happening instead of this one sided video
Vox failed to mention that jews were living there before the ottoman empire and the jees were expelled becsuse the ottoman conquered them
All the Palestinians had to do was not attack Israel end of story
The occupied has the right to resist apartheid occupation the actions of the apartheid occupiers isnt due to Hamas as they were doing samething before Hamas and in non Hamas controlled areas so its due to their hatred of Palestinians

Palestinian Arabs fled the country AFTER the Arab countries declared war on Israel not the other way round You are skewing the facts
quotThe prime minister of the Israeli occupationquot lt that39s an example of someone calling Israel itself occupied as if it39s not a countrybrbrAlso way to gloss over a few decades of pogroms and bombings against Jews by Palestinian Arabs like the 1929 Hebron pogrom and 193639 revolts that attacked Jewish towns

This title reflects our  modern world where powerful are the bad guys and at fault for the behaviors of other people Not that Britain has clean hands but other people came to them Im sure they knew what they were asking for  All sides
Palestinian isn39t even a thing these ppl are Arabs from Egypt facewithtearsofjoy  Lmao
Does anyone know where I could find the original documentary without the censored footage
Tell me again how Israel isn39t a settler colonialist nationalist fascist state
The lies about what is happening are being exposed every day about the land in Palestinian and its governing peoples the European Jew And now the Genocide thats being committed while America and the European countries are in Condon and support it while looking the other way
What charters agreements etc have the British or US ever honoured
Ban Bombs i say When did it become OK to blow men women and children to smithereens That is insane barbaric inhumane beyond words It is sick All disputes from now on should be settled with rational debate and objective evidence combined with a tolerance compromise  and compassion with the goal to find a winwin that brings peace prosperity and justice to the world
This documentary is wholly inaccurate and incomplete
Jews were arabs
I appreciate knowing the history Thank youbrI39d like to say that the British were the catalyst but the atrocities that have taken place by Israel since the 1948 Nakbha are on Israel and also the massive financial support from the USA
IMHO British did not started Arab Israel conflict islamists started the conflict British just take advantage of that and excuse themself to their own benefits

Why there are no names of the expertshistorians
Who were the Jews who were the Arabs and who were the Palestinian Does it means that this documentary also is corrupt
This short film of properly bundled up men shows only two men with gloves and not one hand is inside a pocket  Stunning collection of film  Congratulations
The immediate recognition by USA of the selfproclaimed state of Israel without any recognition of Palestinian rights should also be questioned
With a bit of knowledge of history it would show the nonsense around this issue that passes for fact The real culprits are the Turks They sided with Germany in WW1 so when they lost the decision about what to do with that region fell to the British and the French brbrTry telling this story of the Middle East in the scenario where Germany and its ally Turkey won Then whose fault would the current mess be attributed to Too hardbrbrBut so much simpler and convenient to say it is ALL the fault of Britain Just that Convenient Lazy thinking and poor history
Thank you for  this Library

British wanted Iraqi oile and controls of Suez canal which is near philistines brSo they used the Jews name to forme a state Israel brAnd transport the oils British needed a state where it has access to the sea which was created state Israel brIt39s all about British politics and brControl of other nations Land for itself brLike it did in India brAnd many more countries over the centuries
From 18781948 The British put the Hebrews into captivity 70yrs The Hebrews went against Gods Covenant with their circumcision Galatians 31012 513 and was 2 Peter 21922 notice in verse 2 peter 220 it is the later end which comes before the very end Now the British which still have possession of Israel with their British Jews are now after the Catholics killing and destroying them and killing the people of America to overtake America and give it to PH Just as they came here and killed the Indians with disease and cutting off their food and supplies they back again doing the same thing putting blame on China which I39m sure are helping along with many other countries God bless Now you might understand Daniel 121

I am beginning to ask whether or not that is really true  There is a huge big case of treason going on right this very minuteewe 
But of course Jordan belongs to the Israelitesewe beatingheart 
I am sorry to say that that particular piece of land belongs to the Great God Almighty snd he loves and thinks about every daybrbrThat Israel had to do incredible acts before God to gain that land is well written in the bible history book  Because God made the Israelites his special people for His own purposes has been believed for centuries  So dear hearts what do you think is going on nowbrbrThere is no such thing as a twostate solution  That is something America has trumped up because they do not know the ancient history of that piece of land or they know it and think they can outsmart God  Good luck on that onebeatingheart ewe 
One thing I do know is that the devil is busy trying to confuse us all that he might get to own the earthbrbrTo me the church has fallen away  Therefore what I have learned about Israel may or may not be true  The Jews came back to its land in 1948 thru the Balfour agreement  Jesus inferred that the fig tree is Israel and when we see it bloom we are the generation brThat will see wrath  As some people say now I Say quotI know nothingquot However I do think that in these days we are led by what Jesus Christ tells us as written in Hebrews  And of course we might surely believe that all Israel will be saved when the redeemer comes and takes away their sins and they will be grafted back into the fig tree as stated in RomansbrbrIt is too bad that the church does not engage in serious discussion with its congregants rather than having a human preacher stand in front of us and tell us what to believebrbrPerhaps the church will change it39s waysbrbrI do know there is only one living God who has a Son Jesus Christ both of whom we ought to love forever and praise and we ought to love our neighbor as ourselvesewe beatingheart  In addition the Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit will lead us into all truth  What do you thinkewe 
it is  100 certain that had Israel not been created Muslims would have tried to drive all Jews into the sea There is absolutely no doubt that would have happened Only the creation of Israel prevented genocide

The Jews were in the middle east when Britain was still a hunter gatherer society Yes the British Empire tried to give the Jewish community a country to call their own If they had not the middle east would still be a constant raging war Not everything is as simple as blaming a single party Did the British start the Houthi39s or the multiple differnt versions of the Muslim faith
This should be required history class in all public schools in America All of this was omitted from my public education from 19781990 In 1902 Jews lived in historic Palestine but their numbers were very small the area was inhabited mostly by Arabs Christian and other groups of people but everyone lived together Peacefully 
Britain had no right to give Palestinian land to IsraelPalestinians should sue Britain the blunder
Great documentary but until today has not solved the problems in Palestine Although now everyone knows whose the culprit is
Youre completely wrong on this The UN decided that Jews could have a part of Trans Jordan that the British and French had carved up under the Sykes  Picot Agreement  At the time the member states of the UN had voted for that decision  Go read some books get your eyes off social media bias
Thats the way it was true People make choices Everybodys looking for someone to blame try looking at it Islam
who smartbrnot pigs
I think what people forget is that when you go to war and you losepeople take your stuff The Ottoman Empire decided to fight with Germany They lost against England and America They lost land as a result Thats the way it is brThe reason why The entire Gaza Strip and Westbank is not Israel is because Israel lost the war against the Babylonians in 607BCE Babylon took it Then the MedoPersians took it then the Greeks then the Romas finally destroyed Jewish Jerusalem in 70CE brThese are the facts read your history br After the fall of the Ottoman Empire a small piece was given to the Jews They are there to stay brGet over it
It39s always British fault
China never colonized any country yet they are hated more than colonizers
This mention of Palestinian and Palestinian nationhood is completely fabricated The parts on Arab nationalism are true but I really don39t understand how they can have quothistoriansquot talking about a quotPalestinianquot nation named after quotits peoplequot who are arab when arabs did not want to be called Palestinian the only people in Palestine called Palestinian were Jews Distorting history is harmful to everyone involved it gives false hope and perpetuates lies that lead to genocide Everyone should take these subjects seriously
Absolutely brilliantly made and fascinating documentary
Great documentary thank you I just need to add two things Churchill39s speach at around 40min mark was a lot longer and a lot more damning also his support for Jewish people was purely to upease Americans and subsequently to enjoy their support during the 1st World war Meddling never ends well especially if no one asked for help now it has sparked yet another war
This just proves that the devil owns most of the world leaders brThey sold their souls for thirty pieces of silver brEvil times

Crazy how not keeping your promises can lead to conflicts that span ages

History is a conjunction of two words his story Please me mindful of this definition as you watch this video while there are many truths in the video it39s also has a narrative to promote I am not a historian so I am always leery of the documentaries that I watch to make sure that I am not getting fed a skewed narrative For example at minute a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZXfuqUhzESgampt28754755a Youssef Choueiri falsely states that Palestine was named after the Palestinians ie the Arabs living in that region quotIn the early 2nd century CE the term quotSyria Palaestinaquot literally quotPalestinian Syriaquot was given to a Roman province incorporating Judaea and other territories either before or after the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135quot The Romans called the area Palaestina in an attempt to obliterate the Jewish history and Identity of the area which was had been known as Judea and Samaria Prior to 1948 all inhabitants Jews Arabs and Christians of this area were referred to as Palestiniansbr The Jews were a minority in Palestine prior to 1948 because Jews there are very few Jews in the world Most people are unaware that there are only 157 million Jews in the world and 18 billion Muslims There are also 22 Arabs nationalist or states in the world and only one tiny Jewish state There are some Jews not unlike the Samaritans that have never left the land of Israel since biblical times others have assimilated into the Arab population or were expelled from the land to wander the earth and face persecution br   I would also caution viewers that this documentary cherry picked their historians to support a specific narrative For example Avi Shlaim is part of a group of called the quotNew Historiansquot of Israel Perhaps revisionist historians is too strong a term but it39s safe to say that this group challenges traditional versions of Israeli history which is fine as long as viewers are aware that they are getting a one sided representation from a member of the New Historians My point is that Israeli history is very nuanced and the shades of gray are easily lost to those who are unfamiliar with the polemics that can masquerade as facts br The following is what I gleaned from this documentary the Arabs represented by Hussein bin Ali King of Hejaz Faisal and other Pan Arab nationalist sided with Britain in a gamble to overthrow the Ottoman empire and gain Pan Arab Nationalism and self determination The British and French carved up Arabia into artificial countries based on the Sykes picot plan br  I can imagine that Suni Arab Hashemites had their rivals among the Arabs In the end Jordan gained statehood Following agreement with Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill the Emirate of Transjordan was established on 11 April 1921 The Arabs gamble worked out in the end as they ended up with 22 countries in the middle east even if Saddam Hussein didn39t want to recognize the borders of kuwait because they were drawn up by the British The question is where do we go from here to get to peace in the middle east
OK fine What do we do now from today Blame is easy to assign however how can we rectify the present situation
Biblical Prophesy fulfilled The Jews now have a state of their own
Its always the Brits fault
Totally agree They have a lot to answer for ALL their crimes against humanity for centuries
Brits are basically no1 cause of all issues in world right now Major ones Look at them now their economy is in gutters and they  have decimated with Brexit Circle of life Wales and Scotland want out too
Britain is the secret or overt source of nearly all evils and has been for hundreds of years
Britains responsible for almost every conflict in the world if you really think about it
redheart  it is written in the CHRISTIAN BIBLE that Jews will return back to their homeland May 14 1948 was the date when Israel became officially a nation From USA
Trust Snake but do not trust west
Britain indeed since hundreds of years ago wanted to take over Palestine but failed that is one of the reasons why Britain established the state of Israel and the goal is to prevent Palestine from becoming a recognized state
Interesting spin on events Bit of salt needed Great footage though
An interesting an accounthistory of how this conflict was birthed
Very well presented Thanks so much for this important educational video
Many of british people are angry with what our goverment has done at the start and now they are responsible for this war It seems they went to many countries causing grief and death Bur god is watching and will make them pay

You keep saying that the Jews killed Jesus but he actually died by the Roman39s in their most common way Jesus was arrested by the Jewish authorities but crucified by the Roman governor Therefore both groups were involved in his death but only one group had the power to do so Since the Jews were governed by the Roman39s and were afraid they will destroy the temple again The reasons differ but the fact is he didn39t die by their hands

Esrael Name are politically The true name of the country are Palestine no Esrael name country in Past History map they just used the name of esrael Esrael name is a name of Person not CountryAnd people think they are religious Until they occupied Palestine and used the name esraelbrThe true owner of Zerussalem are Palestine people because zews are only Migrant people they migrant to The land of Palestine because The Germany leader name Hitler are they Killed the zews
There is another problem that is u both are on Christian land God39s Mt  Jesus will be back and then u will run for your lives
Jerusalem was build by King David in 1000BC Gods given land to israel foreverNobody can go against Gods word
European powers carved up the Ottoman empire without asking the Nomadic People that lived there
Palestinians had a country there Israel invaded
That last line couldn39t be more relevant in 2023
I wish they all know that Jerusalem is no longer a holy place After Jesus died the agreement btw God and Israel endedinstead our body is the only holy temple of Godthe truth will always set us free

well regardless its a fact Jews did found the sity the Mosque is built on top of a old temle mound dont have to be a genius to understand whos the 3939native3939
Palestinians dont want to make east Jerusalem their capital they want Jerusalem as theyre capital
Hopefully Jerusalem will be fully restored to Israel
As always religion the root problem of conflict facewithrollingeyes 
Half it or share it explodinghead explodinghead explodinghead 
that is not a holy land that is a curse land
Muhammad isn39t in heaven brbrRevelation 2010 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where are also the beast and the false prophet and they shall be tormented
So this is why Israel and Palestine is at war  The conquest for Jerusalem
There is nothing holy about this place anymore
Jerusalem is not mentioned even once in the Quran It39s however the centerpiece of all Jewish faith
The solution is for Jerusalem to be an independent city state
Tell the  truth Palestinians only want their state who wants Jerusalem are the muslims The plan is to eliminate all Palestinians and claim the land disavowing other arabs All can live there only under Israeli rule
Jerusalem belonged to BneiYisrael before 950 BC During which time was the completion of King Solomons Temple built according to the instructions given by Adonai Elohim so roughly 1600 years before Islam
Respect the religious places  not   too much  u r wearycat rat 
jerusalem has been jewish for 3500 years trump recoggnized that simple
Favourite place for 3 difference gods Not interested to be in other places on earth
quotFor this God is our God for ever and ever he will be our guide even unto deathquot Psalms 4814 KJV  We understand that God cares for us more than we will ever know He rejoices with us in moments of happiness His heart breaks with us in times of sorrow He is present during good times and bad Our lives are His treasure He loves us when we are unloveable and forgives us when unforgivable God is the same from beginning to end He is consistent reliable and loves us unconditionally   Our Father in Heaven You remain devoted to us all the days of our life Thank You for Your eternal presence and everlasting love  In Jesus39 Name Ame
It39s called Al quds
Did Abraham claim this land for Jews or not According to the Bible
The only party bringing violence in Palestine  is the occupation force that has disrupted the peace of Palestinians from 1948
Without a doubt its Palestinians39
religion has been the root of wars through history Jerusalem is important to Israel Palestine and Christens so if it is claimed by any it will lead to conflict so it should never have been a place of politics
Informative I think based on this Israel in the name of peace should give Jerusalem back to the future state of Palestine It means more that a messiah ascended to Heaven than old building locations Christ knew those buildings could be trouble if only he didn39t listen to his brother James to allow it to stand foldedhands dove Israel Jordan 
Every time these two decide to blow each other up the algorithm recommends this video Honestly that is best example of the algorithm doing its job
Jerusalem is a cursed place
Such chaos in a holy land what would god say maybe get along dont be violent
I noticed a pattern herealways fewer Israelis are killed and always triple that number for Palestines
Meanwhile the Christians are just there spectating this beef while everyone kinda forgets they39re there
Jelusalem is jewish 100
I only agree with a video if it fits my narrative
JERUSALEM IS A DO NOT TOUCH  THIS PLACE IS FOR NOBODY IT IS ONLY FOR GOD TOUCH NOT JERUSALEM LOOK AND LEAVE AND YOU SHALL LIVE BOTH SHOULD HONOR THIS PLACEwomanshrugging I AM THE ONLY OWNER SAYS THE LORDfoldedhands 
I dont know why the muslims are obsessed with jerusalem It is a city made by the jews 3 times Jerusalem is not even mentioned in the quran Yet musims think they own the place
Will this be the End now in 2023 
How did the Ottoman Empire got Israel in the first place Yet no one complained that the Ottoman Empire was wrong in Occupying Israel in 1683 during the peak of the power of the Ottoman Empire which controlled the whole of middle east during that time  during that time only the Arabs and Muslims were the dominant occupiers in Israel  The Ottoman Empire is the main cause of the diaspora of the Jews away from their homeland  Now that the Ottoman Empire is gone and the present world powers are the USA British and western   Christian powers  why is everyone complaining why the Jews are wrong in returning to their homeland in  Israel after their diaspora for more than 500 years If the Allied powers did not win the World War 1  the Jews will still be scattered though out the world  The jews returning to Israel is justified after centuries of waiting and praying
It will always be Palestine PalestinianTerritories redheart 
All these wars and killing over control of Jerusalem is pointless  as if these Barbarians could ever get into heaven Both sides are condemned to eternal damnation for how they disregard human life
Jerusaleemit39s both theirs
Christians should take it all from them
Im sorry do they completely ignore the fact that they built there mosque over Solomons Temple
Well isnt Jerusalem in Israel Its like USA claiming Guadalajara because of religion aspect
JERUSALEM BELONGS TO ISRAEL  THAT IS THE TRUTH GODS WORD
Unify Like the Gaza
So interesting thx
This is an opportunity to allow the people of Palestine all 6 million of them to march to Iran where our Father gave them land thousands of years ago I am a Levite Priest from the line of Ancient Israel I love both the people of Israel and of Palestine Soon we will return home to Israel and unlike the Israel you see now we will share the light of our Father and guide the world to be a better place all people are Yahweh39s people and our Father in Heaven loves Israel as much as Palestine who Father also has a purpose for Our Father has told me that and I will do everything for both Israel and Palestinian people Palestine must leave Israel and go to Iran to an area where our Father gave to them thousands of years ago and we in America and also Israel must pay Iran to take them in or finance their way to get there and support them to build a city and survive 
brAll 6 million must leave Israel and help each other to travel  America must buy their gasoline and provide food and water and tents
Religion is the most powerfull destructive tool especially if you want to sell more weapons and boost your economy second are drugs if you want to reduce population 
Did I just see a few people running and jumping over some praying people
America is the cause of the problem Favoring Israel is so despicable No wonder Afghanistan chased the west and US out of their country

To be clear Israel offered a great deal to Palestine and have Jerusalem under international control Proposal was in 2008
Which Israel are we talking about
Engand gave Palestine in 1928 after ww1 to the Jews The Jews where a 8 percent minority compared to to Palestinians in Palestine The Jews are taking the land by force and scam illegal documentation Britain has created the hate between Arabs and Jews
It has been Jewish land for around 3000 years  even if the Jews were expelled in between Even after 1000 years injustice does not become justice What are Arabs doing in Holy Jerusalem and the other holy places of Christianity Nothing at all
If the Palestinians new what a hammer and nail is for maybe they could have a say in the matter
Both claim  1947 Israel  immgrant come from nowhere holocaust peopleclaim tht land belong to themfacewithtearsofjoy facewithtearsofjoy facewithtearsofjoy 
Jerusalem was the capital of Israel long before there were ever any Muslims in existence to defile our world    No matter how much the Palestinians continue to live in a delusional fantasy Jerusalem is not up for discussion
To summarise Israel invaded and stole the lands from Palestine
This is what you get when you make your own fan fiction of a religion that came firstbrbrconflicts on holy lands

Russia should be banned from any submissions talking about Palestinian people as it does the same to Ukrainian people as we speak now Get out of Ukraine land Putler Both Ukraine and Palestine gave right to be invasion free on their land
Russia should worry about its own vicious cycle of attacking its neighbours they still havent given the Habomai Shikotan Kunashiri and Etorofu islands back to Japan so they don39t get to talk about occupation Clowns I love how the Arab world thinks Russia is on their side so gulliable they see the middle east as a tool nothing else

Nice meat
I dont understand
Thats nice did it stop any wars Or is the war continuing regardless
It39s not complicated that is a lie and it39s a simple issue One people stole something from another people and should return it how complicated is that
You know for a video which its title states how complicated is the situation I don39t see really speak about Israel39s side but what can you expect from the Guardian after all
Sorry to break it to you but many of the conficts which are very relevant right now are complicated despite the picture that alt right and wokes try to display
This is the lie they tell you quotit is complicatedquot
it39s the least complicated conflict in history
One israel defeated Jordan in 1967 they captured back the territory the lost in 1948
Its Apartheid
So from what I39ve seen the iusses themselves are not complicated the emotions and which side is 39right39 is The answer I39ve come is this Both sides have been terrorist and both sides have done horrible unspeakable things to civilians But one clearly has more power and is objectively worse becuase of that I can39t find the people of war to support so I support the citizens who are being hurt on both sides Neither groups of people deserve hate simply because of where they come from Call terrorists what they are terrorists Those are the people we as a world should take issue with BOTH sides
Its NOT complicated
It is not complicated but your masters donot allow you to say the truth
There is nothing complicated Palestine has been invaded
It39s not complicated at all Even according to international law Israel is illegally occupying land that was designated for Palestine and even kick Palestinians out of their homes using Jim Crowstyle laws and violence when they resist
Very Well explained Thank You
Its not complicated
At last an objective and informative video thank you
Its not complicated at all actually its fully settler colonialism and genocide of Palestinian people
Its really not complicated land was stolen and the colonizers are playing the victims
IS IT REALLY COMPLICATED This is about something that the USA AGAIN stuck its noses into back after WWII Many people over history have been pushed out of their countries and no one has done anything to rectify all those people39s situation But the US and others forced the creation of a Hebrew State on the backs of those already living there through no fault of there own  In present time these two groups have been at each others throats so much they cannot be forced to stop without a third party stepping and intervening The hate is SOO DEEP most cannot even communicate their hate
Its not quotcomplicatedquot its a colonising force genociding its people
The Bantustans complicates it Dr Norman Finkelstein explains that it is not complicated That Israel uses that as a dodge
Its not complicated at all u guys make it complicated cuz u want to brIts as simple as it was 1947 redexclamationmark 
quotANTISEMITISM IS A MADEUP CONSTRUCT TO JUSTIFY THEIR HORRBLE APARTHIED COLONISATION AND ETHNIC CLEANSING OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND THE US AND GB ARE SUPPORTING ISRAEL COMMITING INHUMANE WAR CRIMESquot
Your video is almost completely useless No one wants to know the fact that there is conflict in the Middle East between the Palestinians and Israel What everyone wants to know is why
One side is a democracy where politicians are accountable The other side cannot get it39s act together
When its the killing of european kids its an atrocity its evil but when its palestinian kids quotits complicatedquot
It39s not complicated at all it39s fairly simple But it39s a very dense subject A lot happened A LOT of small events many large events
Its not complicated Isra3l has always wanted apartheid shame on you Israhelll
It is absolutely NOT complicated Religion based colonialism and genocide on one side indigenous people fighting for their land on the other
Not complicated its the Occupier and its supporters and the Occupied and their sympathisers The occupier has a colonial project to have an Ethno racist state and the occupied wants emancipationequal rights and freedoms This took less than 4mins to read
This is not complicated there is one side with all the power who is backed by the EU and the United States and the other side has been consistently terrorized for nearly a century and holds nearly none of the power Genocide is not complicated its pretty easy to see whats going on in Palestine and it is horrifying Free Palestine PalestinianTerritories  redheart 
It really isnt Really isnt
Its Israels home land the Palestinians can get lost
Is not complicated is simple Palestine is reacting like any country without army will react against the invaders very simple in 1948 Israel didnt exist now they own Palestine They occupied PalestinebrIsrael must leave Palestine they have the right to exist but not in somebodys else land
It really isn39t People just don39t want to face the reality of how isnotrael is mistreating Palestineians
Its not really complicated Thats just an excuse
No it is not complicated but west wanted to appear complicated because the west doesn39t have the will to solve it Why it serves as US base i middle east and imperialist arm inside the Arab world The solution is End occupation apply international law and UN resolutions just like that you achieve peace since the whole problem are caused because of the unconditional impunity by US and its puppets in Europe
My Mom would39ve taken the land and only give it back until they learn to behave properly
The conflict is only complicated if you are a settler living in someones house
This is unhuman act by israel to the palestineenragedface enragedface enragedface 
It39s all about moneybrIt39s all about wealthbrIt39s all about the gas reserves in GazabrEveryone wants Gaza more than ever
Why cant they coexist
Everyone is upset at Israel but it is Hamas that is holding hostages They have said the cease fire will happen and resources return when the hostages are released Get angry with Hamas for not doing so and prolonging this suffering
The undeniable truth is that the neighbour coutries are perhaps the biggest culprit Without the first arab israeli war and 6 days war the reality in the region would have been completely different probably more peaceful and with close to equal land size for both sides
It has never been complicated One side has never respected the law
This war is not complicated it39s never complicated We had  wolfs in sheep39s skin but NOW we have sheep in wolfs skin
Are they simply stealing the land How is it that a neighboring military controls the land but don39t provide resources such as water clean water
ITS NOT COMPLICATED ITS SETTLER COLONIALISM AIDED AND ABETTED BY THE WEST SIMPLE
This is new isreal not the original
I would say a bit slanted against Israel She is correct that settlements have continued though at a faster pace under Likud but she is not correct in suggesting that Israeli governments over the last 30 years have been against a two state solution The US got Israel under Barak to make that deal at Camp David but Arafat rejected it  Also no mention that Israel turned over governing Gaza to the Palestinians in 2005 that Hamas Gaza39s governing authority explicitly dedicates itself to Israel39s destruction nor mentions Oct 7 Israel does not have clean hands nor is morally pure by any means But a great newspaper needs to be a bit more objective and not selective in reporting history
This reminded me childhood story quotTHE CAMEL amp THE NOBEL MANquot Once upon a time a man was travelling through the desert along with his camel It was winter season and nights became very cold in desert After sunset man decided to take rest and set his camp Outside camel felt too much cold and requested the man if he can enter his face inside which was accepted After sometime camel again requested to enter his front legs which was also accepted But it was not enough for the camel and he entered his rear legs as well There was not enough space in the camp amp the man had to sleep outside in the cold Israel isquotCamelquot in this story and the quotNobel Manquot is Palestine
Finally a clear explanation
Its not complicated You just choose to ignore the brutal occupation
Complicated on the contrary its very easy who is the Occupier invader oppressor here who has stolen homes and land who has committed Apartheid who has committed Genocide who has committed Ethnic Cleansing who has committed War crimes against humanity   WHO we all know the answer don39t we
All this for different religions which we have no evidence for if they have any real quotsensequot at all Humanity deserves to vanish from the planet earth if we are not able and willing to live together
Why are people dying over this Why are CHILDREN dying over this Ive heard the complications here but I ask again as a concerned evolving citizen of the world why are people dying over this
its not complicated honestly
Well boy  did  this lady call this one
It s not complicated thats what they want to believe us
So what have we learned from invasion colonialism and occupationbrFrom Ireland to Palestine and hundreds of other placesbrbrNothing
The only settlement of the Palestinian issue would be free elections by all residents of the occupied territories
No its not
Free palastine
The more i learn about itbrI feel bad for Israel
Keep your soldiers away from our civilians
Is not complicated A group of people have stolen lands and the country of another group They must give it back Simple
what a mess brbrThese are precious human lives being lost brbrStop this two state nonsense I say Put up a government for the people by the people that is quotsecularquot This hurts to see
It doesnt seem the least bit complicated to me
Why dont they just move to Egypt I dont get it
Whats so complicated about Israel being an apartheid state Whats complicated is to carefully analyse and articulate this point without being called antisemitic Free Palestine
Mis information and lies 97 undrinkable israeli provides 95 drinkable water electricity and medical supplies to gaza even tho palastine shoot israel for no reason
So to reiterate Israel has been occupying and building and taking land from Palestine for hundreds of years already and Palestine has been and continues to fight back to regain the land
Justice shall be served foldedhandsmediumlightskintone 
Its not complicated brThere is occupation brThere is resistance brEnd brResistance always wins partypopper in old and new history
This felt worth trying to go through

Thanks foldedhands  for the video I agree its complicated
I would never side with terrorists
Where can I watch the whole video of Bethan McKernan She39s very insightful here I want more
It is not complicated It is simply illegal capture of Palestinian land by Israel And torture and massacre of Palestinian citizens for 70 years Don39t say it is complicated It is very clear
Absolute rubbish one sided story
thanks for explianing
This reminds me of the Irish being under British control for many years Its time to recognise the people of Gaza x
The more I learn about this conflict and the history the more I feel compassion towards the Palestine people
The thing is that The Palestinians gave israel place to live in their country when no one was
It39s not complicated at all There is a victim whose land is being usurped and occupied forcefully since 1948 and there is a cruel occupier who kills children women and civilians constantly while stealing their resources and their land  Palestinians are now living every 4 people in 1m2 because of the israeli attacks on gaza  the criminals have thrown 6000 bombs on gaza in only one week brbrBut sadly we live in a hypocritical society where people symphasize with quoteuropeanquot ukranians against Russia but deny pelestine39s right to resist a colonization that stands since 70 years brNeutrality is also wrong  Every human must stand with PALESTINE PalestinianTerritories PalestinianTerritories PalestinianTerritories 
But it39s not complicated at all facewithtearsofjoy 
Amazing how you left out british occupation and how the territory was divided clappinghandsmediumlightskintone  again colonialism at its best
It is not complicated you just deny palestinians their right to exist as humans 
It39s not so complicated at all It is settlers overpowering indigenous people just like in America and Australia
no it39s really not that complicated
Doesn39t look complicated at all to me Israel executed a generation of fathers in front of their sons and now they are obviously out for revenge and they think this strategy is not visible to the world they are sorely mistaken You might have the power like Britishers and you think they won but the universe has cruel ways to make things even
Representation of Iron and mud
Israel has stolen land from the Palestinians
Not complicated
It39s not quotcomplicatedquot if you are student of ancient history and archeologybrThere are no Kings of quotPalestinequotbrThere are no edda39s or poetry from any quotPalestinequot culturebrThere are no  quotPalestinequot ruins or templesbrThere are no quotPalestinequot pottery or coinagebrThere are no quotPalestinequot artifact or clay tabletsbrThere are no quotPalestinequot ancient languages or scriptbrThere is no historical or archeological evidence that there ever was quotPalestinequot country nation or peoplesbrIt is the name of a REGION Like the quotSaharaquot or the quotGreat Steppesquot or the quotAmazonquot
Your question and your according is very bad because  you don39t understand real situation there It39s before Hamaz entering in Israel they attacked the protesters women by international policy  at the ending tome of their festival brbrIf the Gaza39s Palestinian to where go brIf they are expelled where will they go If you asked to leave your own country would you go
I have a feeling religion plays a huge role in all this unnecessary conflict
So how did hamas get all these military equipment and weapons   If Gaza is so small compare to other areas like isreal
This is a helpful video on YouTube  Thank you
It39s like you think they just randomly picked Palestine there39s some thick people nowadays
Newsflash How Palestine reclaimed its stolen land from zionist while the ICC drift charges against Netanyahu and others
Pity that 99 of your claims in your video have been debunked by historical fact But 10 out of 10 for pushing the usual BS as fact Also you clearly are pushing an agenda by leaving out facts that precede events And you saying trust me in the beginning is dubious and hypocritical at best
Palestine did not exist as a distinct political entity prior to the First World War In fact what was defined by the Allied Powers as Palestine actually consisted of bits of three different Ottoman VilayetsSanjaks It wasn39t even one single defined regionbrAfter four centuries of Ottoman Turkish imperial rule over the entire Middle East what became Palestine was governed for five years under allied military occupation and then the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine came into effect putting Great Britain in the role of Mandatory Power as per a legal document called the Mandate for Palestine You are welcome to read the Mandate It is readily available on the internet In it Palestine is recognized as the national home of the Jewish People and the Mandatory Power is obligated by international law to facilitate Jewish immigration and settlement in Palestine to ensure the establishment of the Jewish national home There is a caveat that was added saying that territories east of the Jordan river could be omitted from the Jewish home but specifying territory east of the Jordan clearly implied that all territory west of the Jordan could not be omitted from the Jewish homebrThe mandate came into effect in 1923 so anyone suggesting that the conflict began in the 194039s is either misleading or ignorant In fact the Arabs were fighting tooth and nail against the mandate for years before it even came into effectbrVery little of Palestine was privately owned A great deal of the territory is reminiscent of a moonscape nearly uninhabitable Much of the land settled by the Jews was swamp land that was worthless until the Jews drained the swamps and made them usable for cultivation All this had been taking place since the Zionist movement was founded in 1897 and even before that Neither during the British nor Ottoman rule were Jews quotgivenquot land belonging to Arabs Certainly Jews could not quottakequot or as Palestinians love to allege quotstealquot land The idea that the governing Turks or Brits would allow that to stand is ludicrous The Jews were sold land both privately as well as public land and Jews worldwide donated funds to finance the purchase of lands in Palestine After violent rioting and massacres carried out by Arabs in protest the British authorities actually mapped out areas where it was illegal for Jews to be sold propertybrWhat did occur in 1947 specifically on November 29 1947 was the UN vote to ratify resolution 181 which detailed the UNSCOP plan to partition Palestine thereby providing individual quotindependentquot States to Palestine Arabs and Palestine Jews In addition the Jerusalem district was to be governed for up to ten years by a UN trusteeship The two States were to have an quoteconomic unionquot though what that meant was unclear What was clear was that not a single Arab or Jew would have to be displaced No property was to be lost Arabs residing in the Jewish State were to be given the option of Arab State citizenship if they desired The two States were to have an initial population of 800000 each with 100000 Jews and 100000 Arabs remaining in the Jerusalem UN trusteeship The Arab State was to be almost exclusively Arab The Jewish State would have 300000 Arabs and 500000 Jews though hundreds of thousands of Jews awaited the opportunity of resettling in the Jewish State after being displaced during the HolocaustbrI suppose you could say that the League of Nations officially and by international law recognized the Jews as the rightful quotindigenousquot people of Palestine in 1923 and decreed that Palestine be transformed into the Jewish national home over the course of the Mandatory period In that respect all of Palestine was given to the Jews in 1923 The UN then recommended that the Jews renounce their title to half of Palestine at the end of 1947 giving the remainder to what the Mandate calls the quotexisting nonJewish communities in Palestinequot ie the quotPalestiniansquot The Jews actually acceded to the UN39s suggestion to that effect however the Arabs insisted that they exclusively were entitled to Palestine in its entirety in part because they had succeeded in preventing the mass immigration of Jews envisioned by the League of Nations Six million Jews were slaughtered and yet the Jewish population of Palestine remained six hundred thousand short of a majority Who knows how many Jews would have survived Nazi extermination had the British not appeased the Arabs and barred Jews from escaping to Palestine And yet millions of people are convinced that the Jews have no rights in Palestine because the Arabs in 1948 had succeeded in maintaining their majoritybrOn May 14 1948 the Mandate ended and the British left On May 15 1948 the armies of Syria Egypt Transjordan Iraq and Lebanon crossed their recognized international borders into what had been until the day before Mandatory Palestine with the express intention of destroying the nascent Jewish State and seizing all of what had been Palestine for the Arabs Nothing was given However by transforming Palestine into a battleground the Arab armies caused a massive refugee crisis The Palestine Arab population had no intention of living in a Jewish State they were persuaded that if they remained the Jews would massacre them and commit atrocities upon them and those who attempted to confront Israeli forces in armed combat were forced to flee They were assured that the Arab armies would defeat the Jews and they would be able to return to their homes shortly As a result of the combination of these causes vast numbers of Palestine Arabs fled abandoning their properties and choosing to live as refugees rather than being loyal citizens of the State of IsraelbrIn the aftermath of the 19489 quotWar of Independencequot the properties abandoned by the refugees living within countries that remained at a constant state of war against Israel unable to return and unwilling to live at peace with the Jews were gradually confiscated by the government of Israel and redistributed as Jews who had awaited the opportunity to rebuild their lives in the Jewish homeland after the horrors of the Holocaust were finally able to come homebrThe Arab claim is that the Jews are colonists and have no legitimate connection to Palestine To believe this one needs to be either intentionally ignorant or a tremendous conspiracy theorist The history of the region and of the Jewish People is beyond question and yet that is exactly what those trying to delegitimize and vilify Israel do Yet it is academic What matters is that the League of Nations was clear in its recognition of the rights of the Jewish People and the historical connection between the Jews and the Land of Israel The Jewish national home has been reconstituted and day by day Israel becomes more prosperous and secure while the Arabs of Palestinian descent become more and more mired in their hatred and intransigencebrThe Arab claim to being entitled to the exclusive hegemony throughout what was Palestine quotfrom the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Seaquot is not a valid claim It has never been The Arabs have been given hegemony throughout the entire Middle East which they conquered in the seventh century only to be defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century One of every five Israeli citizens is Arab and enjoys democratic equality under the law despite claims to the contrary The Palestinians of the West Bank and even the Gaza Strip could benefit from a mutually beneficial partnership with Israel based upon the principles of cooperation compromise and coexistence Those are principle they have to accept upon themselves They cannot be forced upon thembrTragically it is their obstinate refusal of normalization that prevents Palestinians from achieving prosperity By incessantly lambasting Israel while making no demands or even criticism of the Palestinians the obvious bias of the international community encourages the Palestinians to remain intransigent and to avoid engaging with Israel to resolve this perpetual conflict Your own suggestion that the Palestinians have a valid claim without even having considered whether the Jews39 claim is equally valid is symptomatic of the reason the Palestinians remain in their current situation The Jewish People have an inalienable right to selfdetermination in their ancestral homeland even if the United Nations seems only to have attributed that right to the Palestine Arabs Until that truth becomes apparent to the Palestinians and the world at large there is no hope of a resolution to the conflict
How did the Jews end up in England
I love when people condemn Britain for colonialism and then condemn decolonisation as Britain handing over their problem to someone else Also I found this video very informative and fascinating Particularly with regards to the selection of facts
So that means we shoulfnalso stop the immigration and land taking of muslims in Europe I guess There are millions of settlers in Europe winkingface 
He keeps saying quotthey lost their countryquot but there was no country Yes individual families might have lost their individual plots of land but they were living on land occupied by the Ottoman Turks
People act like they know the history after reading one article Do more research and try again
Sounds like what happened in the usa
How would Israel defend its truly  hideous occupation of the West Bank
This video is spewing nonsense and leaving out all information thats inconvenient to your argument
Have you even heard of the kingdom of Israel with king David Solomon and Abraham It was there 6000 years ago
maybe theland quotcouldquot have been Isreal39s doesn39t give them the right to randomly kill kids in the streets of Gaza like at all if they were religous people they first approach shouldn39t have been killing innecent people and aressting litte kids people everyday get shot and murdered and kicked out their homes

Palestine was ruled by the British 95 of the population was Arabs of different religions Britain then gave it to Zionists and they took it over The truth is simple dont complicate it
Resr in peace everyone
Plastilin is The Century39s AntiSemitism Invention as a Continuity to the 1938 agenda
It39s interesting that a whole side of the story you chose to say is simply quotnot complicatedquot because you deleted the facts  Suddenly bout of nowhereb the United States accepted that there is a country  Suddenly bout of nowhereb the British just gave a state package like a chocolate package  Yes friend apparently when you tell history like a threeyearold child it39s really not complicated
well says all u says its true and happenA great video
Israels wars with its Arab neighbors Are we a joke to you
This is so funny facewithtearsofjoy 
You so called Palestinian just want to steal jewish land And eliminate Israel state It will never be happen So get over and move on build yourself a Palestine country Stop jealous in jew
It always was Jewish land 3000 years So called Palestinians are from Egypt and Jordan and Arabs countries  Second Arabs leader demands Arabs to leave their home after 1948  Thoes who stay become Israeli Arab  And by the way it wasnt million Palestinians layer
Exactly what happened to the Serbians in Kosovo in Serbia but nobody bats an eyelid Where the Albanians ethnically cleansed the orthodox Serbians once they became a majority over time Serbians made a mistake to allow them over the border to work when they were a minority and didnt know they were planning on becoming a majority and then with the help of the West for their own agenda to get a foot in Europe were able to steal the landfacewithopenmouth  horrible human race is only for land and greed Serbians built Kosovo the centuries with hundreds of ancient monasteries and infrastructure only to be stolen by the invaders
They just took the promise land back if they were as bad a people say they are there would be no Palestine
makes you wonder what hitler was up too ey
Viva Palestine redheart redheart 
You can actually smell the misinformation literally bubbling out of this guys mouth
The Enigma of the Arabs and Israelis brbrIn all human societies  whatever their identities are are all land based grounded and have their identities defined from within their land territories Now in human terms it means a lot One of the means to secure the space in which this community exist is off course is to control it by force or war This means shedding blood of its own members Now shedding blood for land territory in ethnic societies around the third world means purchasing land with blood of their members The other is off course is to leave behind markers evidence historical monuments written or oral history etc The third is off course their culture traditions language or the living cultures Fourth they have to occupy this territory or space for very long periods measured in generations after generations of its members brbrNow regarding the question of the Arabs residing in Israel and its territories from records of history it has been occupied by a lot of ethnic groups from both the neighboring Arabs in the first century and before that by Greeks the Romans and even much earlier than that the bibilical nations Israel also came into the fore when it conquered the resident bibilical nations like the philistines the Jebusites Amorites etc Israel rightfully claimed the territorial space by war built a civilization there for over 3 millennia until the Roman empire dispersed them throughout the Roman empire Still there were Israelis living there in Israel up to the modern era The Palestine name came much much later during the time of arafat and the PLO movement Now the Israelis feel that they need to return to their homelands after the fall of the Roman empire and the rise of modern nations of Europe and in other parts of Africa Americas Asia and the Pacific brbrIf you look at this historical context really the people of israeli as a nation have a valid claim over their historical lands where their ancestors have lived and left an indelible mark and a name identity they created for very long periods in human history Now their children will stand for this name their identity and their land You cant blame them for this If the arabs and muslims around the world can read and accept world history perhaps they can find peace and understanding of who are the jewish and israeli people are If we cover up the facts and fuel our egos with hate and ignorance then we have a serious issue with our we create a world in the 21st centurywe might as well evolve into the dark ages
Check your book who stole Israeli
nah bro but the actual fact that in the quran it is written that the land belongs to the jewish
The Jews have lived in that region since the time of Joshua in the Bible since around 1400 bc Many times the Jews were driven out of their land but there has always been some Jews living in the land First the Assyrians took it over then the Babylonians Cyrus of Persia allowed them to rebuild the temple which the Romans destroyed when they dispersed the Jews from the land and Hadrian renamed the land Palestine I am amazed at how ignorant people are about history You obviously need to do more research so you can get ALL of the facts
Can this be more historically wrong Wow
Torah never mentioned PalestinebrBible never mentioned PalestinebrQuran never mentioned Palestine brbrFrom when Palestine exist
You can tell if someone actually believes what they are saying by what information they present
I wonder if all this would still be happening if israel kept the sinai peninsula from egypt
No its not complicated Everyone agreed on a two state solution except for the Arabs so thats why we went to war Hamas decided they didnt like it a 2  state solution I think youre incredibly biased And youre not telling the full truth about history
I hope you cover the historical fact that there never was a country by this name That the socalled Palestinian people are a moderate invention And that archeology proves historical fact of it being Israel39s land back to 4000 years ago Your fake country has never had a prime minister never had its own official language no official government  It39s amazing how people can be so ignorant and not research historical facts and buy this BS  Jordan is Palestine

You forgot to mention way before 1916 34 AD a Jew name Jesus Christ lived in that land and was killed by the Romans
This is not true  Palestine was actually owned and occupied by one of the 12 Tribes of Israel in the Bible from thousands of years ago  Say what you will  The Bible holds the TRUTH  It has always been part of Israel
Whoops there goes the neighborhood
it starts with Arabs pilligeing the Roman empire not ww1
Israel didn39t steal anything It was their land
This video is ABSOLUTELY absurd please dont listen to a word this guy says
NOW Lets tell the story from the Israels perspective Lets talk about how the land that was overwhelmingly Jewish and Christians became nearly entirely Muslim Your answer is probably gonna be well that was a long time ago brbrIGNORANCE
Funny how you ignore the fact that JEWS were forcibly removed or fled when the Ottoman Turks and Muslims nations conquered the area known as Palestine br         They didnt just choose this land by flipping a coin
How about start from the BEGINNING This issue started long before WW1 The Jews settled that land long before Islam was a thing Lets start at the very start
Absolutely wrote his own history of this situation please people do your research and make your own decisions
Don39t forget the 39Balfour Declaration39  Lord Rothschild was involved  says it all

How can the Palestinians ask for a state when they are the invaders and occupiers of foreign land
Only 2 flags have no state LGBT and ISRAEL
So Israel was there before Palestine Palestine took control Israel had already been taken over more than a few times If you start it at 1916 then yeah Palestine was occupying the land at the time If you go back to BC then Palestines land originally was not the country they are in now If you look it up you can follow where the Jews went from bc until present day you can go back and follow historical documents that show the wars the migration Its there now everyone has to push an agendaopinion instead and leave out all the history before 1916
Jews were there 1200 years before islam even existed
Your information path is full of holes and omissions  Unfortunately you have been betrayed by your decisions and your leaders Jews in Israel predate your people proven by history and the bible Nice try feeble though
Heres a question kbappe why were Jews in Europe to begin If ancient texts and Roman history report some to be in the Middle East why did they have to move to Europe Rise of Islam perhaps
IT SI NOT COMPLICATED  EUROPEANS AND USA WANT TO HAVE A COLONY IN THE RESOURCE RICH MIDDLE EAST UNDER MULSIMARAB CONTROL   ALSO USA  WANTS PEREPETUAL WAR EVEN AFTER THE ISRAELPALESTINIAN CONFLICET IS OVER WARS WILL CONTINUE BECAUSE THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMLEX IN USA ON PERPETUAL WALL    ISRAEL AND AMERICAN  DEPEND ON ARMS SALES  THE WAR DEPARTMENT IN USA HAS UNLIMITED UNQUESTIONED SUPPORT ON THEIR BUDGET    ONLY THE ECONOMIC DOWNFALL OF THE USA AND ISRAEL WILL FREE PALESTINIANS   SOME NATURAL CATASTROPHY OR WWIII  OR DIVINE INTERVENTION SIMILAR TO  THE DAYS OF LOT THAMUD FIRAOON NOAH  ETC ETC brMAY ALAH SEND HIS JUSTICE TO PALESTINE AGAINST THE OPPRESSORS AMEEN

Populistic video you omitted the following factsbrbr1 The Arabs countries calling Arabs to leave their homes in Israel in 1948 with a promise they would return after the won the war which they lost And also you omitted the actual Arab invasionbrbr2 The fact that similar partitions in the area created other Arab countries which are basically ethnically same to so called Palestiniansbrbr3 The facts that Israel actually BOUGHT most of the land from Arabs so they could own itbrbr4 That the territory that wasn39t part of the partition plan was conquered when it was fought over with Arab armiesbrbr5 That the west bank and Gaza were not occupied until 1967 and after that Jordan and Egypt the countries that Israel conquered the land from DON39T WANT THE PALESTINIANS OR TERRITORY BACK
no it starts with The Creator God who made the promise the covenant  with Abraham and his seed Jews and only Jewsno one will ever take it 
I don39t agree with the genocide on EITHER SIDE of this conflict but unfortunately there39s nothing that can be done There can39t be peace without understanding and some choose not to understand peacebrbrThe Jews lost their home they were exiled they were still mistreated in Europe then they fled back to the land they originally lostbrbrBoth sides aren39t innocent You can win by destroying an enemy sure but don39t be surprised when another comes for vengeance
So basically   don39t let a bunch of people immigrate into your country if they don3939t speak your language share your values and don39t look like you   otherwise you end up with endless conflict  Got it   but it sounds pretty xenophobic to me  QUEERS FOR PALESTINE  Also   Chickens for KFC
And also at the time of the 2nd World War the USA rejected the Idea to take ALL Jewish People to their own Country Therefore the US Goverment supported from the beginning the Creation of the artificial Construction of the so called quotIsraelquot on Palestinian Land

Clearly the narrative is FAKE There is no such thing as ethnic Palestinians just ARABS living in Mandatory Palestine at that time and the British gave them land its called Jordan Its like saying that if the Pilgrims migrated to the US in the 130039s they would be considered native americans
This video is a good example of an incredible manipulation with historical facts And it is really sad so many young people in the western world believe it only because they think the one who is poor is the quotgood guyquot while the rich one is the quotbad guyquot What does HAMAS fear the most PEACE If there is PEACE there is no HAMAS and no billions of dollars sent to Qatar
Palestine never existed as a sovereignty How can it be stolen

That39s not true the pattern actually is Muslims Islamic empires such as Ottoman empire or Palestinians stole the land from ancient Romans who stole it from ancient Jews then in 1948 the Jews said we just want a portion of our land to have an actual state in it you arabs or Palestinians can have the rest but the Palestinians said no we want the rest of it we don39t care if it was yours back in the ancient times we steal it we get it The Jews then said ok we39re gonna steal back some of it then and they did and the Palestinians cried Nakba even if they still have some piece of the said landpersonshrugging facewithtearsofjoy 
No one stole anything from anybody  Another terrible propagandist spewing his BS  1948 UN resolution actually gave the Palestinian Arabs  23rds of the area now called Gaza Israel and the West Bank  Additionally there was also tremendous violence against the Jews also living in these areas by Arabs  You never hear about this from the Palestinian propagandists  Jews and Arabs BOTH were evicted from some of the areas they inhabited  Again you wont hear about this from the Palestinian Arabs
I stand with Palestine PalestinianTerritories 
They bought their land from absentee Turkish  landlords and rich Arabs who moved to England  America and the Arab countriesbrEverywhere you lookthe Arab League  countries sold you out
This video is right away nonsense falsity and misinformation Nah thanks
Your title very wrong you know the history
Israel didnt steal anything It was their ancestral home
Why is no one holding the UN responsible The british turned the problem over to the UN who handled it They just up and gave them land they havent given any other displaced people land what about native americans What about Tibet No UN just gives isreal land displacing palestinians at the time and worse clearly until now  letting them take more and  and no one is pointing arms at them They caused it
Its not that complicated sounds like how America was created taking something that belonged to someone else and using the Bible as a souce
Lies
Interesting commentary  I39d like to know where you get your facts  Seems to me that the area which is now Israel was largely unoccupied as it was mostly a wasteland devoid of life  Seems to me the Jewish people spent decades refurbishing and replenishing the land to make it capable of sustaining life  Seems to me the mass pilgrimage back to the homeland was out of loyalty to work and help to rebuild that which was lost  brSeems to me the first mention of Palestine is actually Palestinia which the Romans renamed the area of Judeanow Israel after a massacre  This is also a reference to the Philistines who were nonArabs that dwelt in the area now called Gaza  Those people are gone to historybrIt seems to me the next mention of Palestine is in 1917 when the British ceded the land formerly part of the Turkish Empire to the Jews and the Zionist state  At that time the area was named Palestine but the population was very sparse because most of the area was wastlelandbrThe next mention of Palestine is by Yassar Arafat who fostered war with the Jews by funding the terrorists to attack Jewish settlements  With much publicity he created the palestinian people which before did not existbrSeems to me that every effort at peace has been refused by these 39palestinians39 as they are funded by the Iranian government to create chaos in the region  These poor people have been brainwashed for decades and no longer have much claim to humanity  Witness what happened when they emigrated to Jordan and to Lebanon  Civil war and terrorismbrI might be missing something but it seems to me that the area of Israel was largely inhospitable and therefore unoccupied until the Jewish people came and rejuvenated it  There is much documentation about this  Explorers from the turn of the century remarked how desolate the area was  Then in the 193039s journalists were writing how the Jews had transformed the area into a paradise against all oddsbrI am sure there are missing pieces to this puzzle but I am not at all sure there really is a palestinian people as they are not in any historical narrative  brYet in 2005 Israel ceded Gaza to these people  It was a paradise of gardens and ports and beautybrThey could have built a state and won the envy of the world instead they destroyed it  UtterlybrNow they wish to destroy more  And if the succeed and eliminate the Jews then what  Egypt Jordan Lebanon Since they are terrorists and destroyers where will it end
So if Jews were 10 of the population should 10 of the land be given to the Jews
Im a New Zealander and I find it hard to understand the different claims each group has for the contested lands Its confusing and living on the other side of the world makes it all that more removed from reality unfortunately brbr     What land you claim has been stolen from the Palestinians exactly The land with all those thousands of years of Jewish history where all the countless millions of Jews have lived generation after generation Is that the land that has been stolen from the Palestinians The land with all those Jewish geographic and cultural place names is that the land you mean

Palestinians are a fictional group In 1948 there were no plans whatsoever for a Palestinian state nor any mention of a Palestinian people Those terms were conjured up around the 1960s to play victim In 1948 the plan was simple  destroy Israel kill all the Jews Finish Hitler39s work basically The Arabs started a war and failed They have never accepted this loss and still hate IsraelbrbrLook at the treatment of Jews across the Middle East This receives barely any attention About 800000 Jews fled not because of war but because of gov39t systematically taking away their rights along with numerous pogroms About 460 million Arabs and within their countries they barely have space for about 20000 Jews today In contrast 2 million Arabs live in IsraelbrbrThis is one of the most blackandwhite issues in politics and one of the issues with the most vehement and widespread propaganda including this video At this point to support Palestine is to unabashedly support terrorism
Palestine is like a box of chocolates  Oh the eloquencefacewithrollingeyes brHelps that the narrator points at us repeatedly  Ironic that this fellow looks and sounds to be a product of some kind of mixed background    This video is weird badaddled stuff  I hope the narrator has had time to go home sit a bit and rethink his next attempt at lecturing anyone BEFORE he opens his mouth
Ahh that remember me to the Palestinian quotKiDquot sry but for me a Kid is under 13 that has to go to jail for nothing When he goes inside he was 16 and later he can go with 18 because of a Prisoner change Thats so sad ahh wait he wasnt innocent What he stabbed 3 Jews to Death yeah but its just because of the Jews evil Israel ah what How dare u calling me the quotAWordquot

I think this creates a pretty unrealistic political perspective The defenses are not there for kids with rocks they are there for very valid reasons from an Israeli pov With regards to kids getting shot at just remember it is not uncommon for radical Islamic groups such as Hamas to weaponize children so soldiers will not dismiss a situation just because a child is involved Is this a bad situation for innocent Palestinians absolutely My heart goes out to all of the innocent people suffering as a result of this conflict on both sides For those of you that are appalled by what you see well that is war for you any war doesn39t matter who the participants are

Isreal is a terrorist state shame
israel will always be scared
Some people believe that Israel is defending itself but they forget that the entire land belongs to the Palestinians and Israel is merely a Western occupying force Some believe that Israel is technologically superior while the Palestinians do not have minds while they forget that Israel after a 20year siege of Gaza and preventing any type of materials used in wars and with endless supplies of the latest Western technology and trained people has not yet been able to overcome the resistance in Gaza and is now embarking on a process of starving civilians and killing as many children and women as it can to put pressure on the resistance due to the failure of the IsraeliAmerican mind to overcome the Palestinian mind It is like a huge wrestler entering the wrestling ring with all internationally forbidden weapons in front of a weakbodied opponent without a weapon and when it becomes clear that this cowardly wrestler is losing his team puts pressure and intimidates the weak wrestlers family into surrendering
They shouldn39t be surprised about homemade grenades considering how long they39ve oppressed the palestinians
Stop this monster called I s r a e l NOW watermelon

Israel is a highly militarized country that develops and exports new weapons They regularly test new surveillance and military technology in Palestine and make big profits by exporting these technologies to other countries Many Palestinian casualties result from such testing but of course Israel always make excuses and say that they39re fighting socalled terrorists
This is called border patrol and control Just dont trespass
Lie after lie Pathetic
And the world just watched like its ok in this day and age for this kind of treatment to people who actually own that country in the first place and Israel just taking it like they have the right to do so its just so astonishing that the Arab countries just let it happen casually without making the world see what was going on

Attacks from both sides are disgusting The deaths from either side need to stop
That is not terrorism Israel has right to defend itself Pathetically low if it is  civilized thought  Should all the countries adopt this technology to oppress civilians Will it promote progress or fear  Israel is Terrorist state 
And there39s absolutely no reason at all they39re putting up all that security is there

Today39s Palestinians have more Jewish genes than European Jews who claim the land as their own and are the original inhabitants of that land the same people who were forced to leave their homes and then had to watch them bulldozed the same people who were expelled their families murdered their children kidnapped and summarily imprisoned the same people Who have to live under occupation and apartheid rules Most rabbis agree
The Jews are the sons and daughters of Abraham Isaac and Jacob They have the right to live in this land
Ukraine Ukraine heartsuit Israel Israel  stay strong Israel
Palestine is the Land Canaan The historic Land of Palestinians Palestine will be at the end liberated from the zionist Occuopation There is no doubt
You can not displace a population the way the did displace Palestinians The so named quotjewishquot problem was a European problem Now it is Zionism Pray you never have them as your enemy
some very wrong quotfactsquot are stated in this documentary  Israel controlling all Gaza borders and Gaza as an quotopen air prisonquot is about as wrong as you can be also quotpalestiniansquot like that quotteacherquot murderer were not quotforcefullyquot removed from their homes they CHOSE to leave as they were under the impression they would have ALL of israel in a few months  Haifa until today is inhabited by Jews and Arabs alike the Arabs that CHOSE to stay in Israel the Arabs that did not make it their sole mission to kill and destroy anything that is Israel The Arabs that are in the Israeli parliment today and as high as the Israeli Supreme court I hate these quotcompassionatequot documentaries that give Murderers and terrorists Justification for what they do

This documentary is biased and not telling the complete truth  The Israelies only attacked Egypt as a preemptive strike because they were going to be attacked first and had to foil the enemies plan Israel had every right to protect themselves  Other facts have been excluded but Egypt has managed to keep their peace treaty with Israel to date  Also the Israelis have always owned the land  God said He gave the quottitle deedquot of the land to the seed of Abraham isaac and Jacob  Not to mention their land would extend from the border of Egypt up to the Euphrates River over 300000 square miles PLEASE READGenesis 1518

State of Palestine not Israel
       
Why did the Arabs run away in 1948 Surely if you believe its your land you stay and fight for it
it is important to note that Palestine is the name of a geographical region and not the name of a nation or people the real name of this land is the land of Hnaan on this land in ancient times there were two Jewish kingdoms Israel and Judea there was no Palestine when the Romans conquered this  land in order to punish the Jews they called this land Palestine  so everyone who lives on this land including Jews can call themselves Palestinians because this is not a nation these are the names of the land but those who call themselves Palestinians by nationality are in fact Arabs who migrated to this land from Syria Lebanon Egypt Jordan   all this has been proven historically and not only in all the holy books the Torah the Koran the Bible it is written that the land of Khnaan belongs to the Jews by Gods call there is not even a mention of the great Palestinians
Every time Palis start intifada they get NAKBA they never learn anything at all They all became persona non gratas all around the world The day they accept Israels independence and start peaceful co  existence their liberation will come but no sign of it
Lots of new things I had never known on the conflictgreat documentary thanks you

its not a conflict its an Israeli occupation
Isreal and Benjamin  the Hitler and leapole of the century
I think it39s safe to say this is the most complex conflict there exists It39s not black and white like many people try to portrait We cannot say that there is a clear quotgoodquot and quotbadquot side in this conflict May there be peace one day although I think we won39t see that in our lifetime

Imagine 60 years ago Israel state was established Now 2024 the Palestinians are enslaved people by Israel However if the Arab states combine their resources men money amp materials to a war of attrition pocket wars in Gaza Hezbollah Houthis Syria Iran among others then Israel39s economy shall be downgraded Only a 2state solution can resolve this conflict as per UN resolution w a UN force with teeth to oversee the implementation
The historical record bears out the claim Google the Arch of Titus erected in the Roman Forum

U left out the actual cause of Nekba They could39ve stayed under belfour but instead started war when they along with all surrounding Arab nations decided to gang up and attack Israelthey caused death and displacements while ruining the belfour Instead of moving forward like the several hundred million ppl they keep up the same insanity
Lets all relax and get real here Polish belong in Poland Nazis belong in Germany and Zionists belong in Austria These three groups are in Palestine acting like theyre middle eastern
This documentary left out the Egypt border saying Gazans were stuck due to Israel borders on all sides Egypt has an equally solid border because despite being Muslim they dont like Palestinians They allowed them to live in Egypt for a time but the Palestinians decided to attempt to overthrow the Egyptian government Not a smart move
This documentary leaves out that Israel would not be a military superpower without the massive unlimited support of the USA This is why the USA and Israel are hated in the middle east and rightfully so

The Bible is many stories passed down and changed over time no real evidence in any who owned the land and whoever has the archeology narrate  interpret and perceive document how they want Ridiculous to claim something from a story that supposedly 3000 years ago that the land God chosen people so the people who have been in that region and ancestry from there they are getting genocide
 60   75       1948             
Some things the documentary leaves out that is somewhat important It was the Arabs that started the first war and asked the 700000 Palestinians to leave their homes and return after quotthey kill all the jewsquot Another fact all the neighboring Arab countries expelled all their Jews to Israel during the same period yet nobody ever talks about them It39s important to point out who started the war it would dispel a lot of sentiment of entitlement towards Palestinians to the land lost
docudramas of Al jazeera are far better
the war between Israel and Palestine started since DAVID AGAINST GOLIATH

Why is everyone okay with Ukraine having a cultural hatred for russians but theyll call these people terrorists Not to even mention Myanmar lol wheres thatbrbrHint Check the skin pigmentation of the participants Just a little trick Ive picked up over the years
And that religious book one of you mention belongs to billions of believers Jews and Christians So far every prophecy is fullfilled Seven more to come and we are at the cusp of it The B agreement gave the Jews back their original land including Judes Bethlehem and all what the people of Gaza wanting to steel Even if they succeed for a short time due to the partial world pressure on Israel the price one pays when some people want to steel from God  is cursed
TQ you story about Israel
Crazy people
The Jews have records going back to 3500 years archeological facts more than enough to satisfy the claim if you ever had any education in history ancient history The Arabs living in Gaza actually land of Israel belong to Jordanian tribes and had been driven out of Jordan by Hussein the current king Abdullahs father Black September for this tribe had been infiltrated by jihadic terrorists Arafat an Egyptian born terrorist who called it the PLO Got a long time now no other Arab countries welcome this people as they created trouble everywhere the lived So by the curtesy of the stupidest Oslo agreement the Israelites got stuck with this killers having Hamas as their mentors

The problem is one side of the conflict is not willing to live in peace with the other sidebrOne side wants the other side dead and no compromise This has been the case for almost 80 years I have not seen one story that is from the Israeli side or showing two sidesonly show from the perspective of the Arabs Palestine is not a country but Israel is a country

You don39t use the right terms and facts Arabs could have a state but rejected it They refused to Accept Israere l Many of the Arabs were immigrants from arab countries and not originally palestine On the Nacba they were told by arab countries to live their homes until they will kill Israelis But the jewish didn39t die  800000 jewish were sent from their homes in arab countries You didnt mention it You didnt mention the attacks arab countries did That Egypt controlled gaza the gaza people are not palestinians They are  Egyptians Jordan controlled the west bank they were jordanians Not palestinians brGaza was slams before and better with Israrl

For journalists the world living in layers is a double standard Did I see Western countries saving Russia because Putin was weakening their plans  forced  many councils and now they support Israel to continue killing innocent people Where is The court issued arrest warrants for Putin saying that Putin kidnapped children who would now be living a good life why don39t they arrest Netanyahu after he killed more than five thousand children

The news should say Israeli genocide on Gaza not Israel T war
Israeli government is international criminal group
iDF implores for a month for the Un involved Palestinians to move south Many did but many didnt because Hamas is preventing them from doing so That is their shield That is also why rockets that are fired over civilians in Israel for years are placed in side civilian neighborhoods inside mosques schools and so on They know that up until now Israel didnt fire at those places What happens in and underneath the hospitals is the same All Hamas leaders are in underground Gaza and their headquarters are underneath Hospital

Islam is not a religion Its a pure Satanism and people are fooled and are in dilution that its a god Its the Satan which take the form of God and make people to obey him not to question his laws which is completely unacceptable

At this moment when Israel has sent most of its forces into Gaza if Israel39s enemy countries attack Israel Israel will lose its strength  If we allow Israel to win the Hasa war and be a bystander with the peace of mind that quotour country has not been attackedquot then Israel which until then relied only on its warplanes and powerful weapons will gain strength in ground attacks with the experience of the Hasa war  In that inspiration we can see attacking Yemen or Lebanon next  Because Israel is now gnawing at Gaza  Some allied countries that cannot bear it are biting Israel from the sides  Israel will look back with a bloody mouth at the end of the story of Hazara to those sentient nations that had been biting it until then  Israel will flow with a country in it  After that it will be impossible to keep up with Israel  If Israel To create a state of fear all Middle Eastern countries will have no other option but to be slaves to Israelbr It is well known that Saudi Arabia is a brainless spineless lazy country that enjoys selling its resources to the US  While other countries are bolder the reason for reluctance at this time is not understood  But in later days you will realize that the situation will not continue

Question Why is no one calling out Hamas for hiding behind their citizens thus putting them in harms way willingly and for the initial attack on israeli civilians Let me be clear i get that IDF needs to stop blowing up civilians an eye for an eye makes the world go blind and calling out and protesting is warranted But NOBODY is calling out Hamas What gives What makes it okay for Hamas to use their civilians as human meat shields Why only call out Israel Someone clarify

Calling the territorial conflict between Israel and the Palestinians minimizes the brutality of Apartheid in South Africa If you want to understand why the term doesn39t apply to Israel read quotDrawing Firequot by South African antiApartheid activist Benjamin PogrundbrbrYou intentionally left out that Apartheid is intended to be permanent domination based on race 1 There is no intention for the occupation to continue permanently and 2 there are millions of Palestinian citizens of Israel who have full civic equalitybrbrAlso Palestinians in East Jerusalem are entitled to apply for Israeli citizenship Many choose not to but there was an uptick in applications following the Oslo accords presumably because they wanted the option of remaining in Israel following a twostate solution

Regarding claims that Israel is an apartheid state he said quotHas anyone of you come to see apartheid in this country It doesn39t exist Apartheid doesn39t exist quotSame way those Jewish tunnels quotdon39t existquotquotANY MOREquot  rollingonthefloorlaughing rollingonthefloorlaughing rollingonthefloorlaughing rollingonthefloorlaughing rollingonthefloorlaughing rollingonthefloorlaughing 
Israel has wasted decades in conflict with Palestine The shortsightedness of its leaders has led the country into a highly militarized state hostile to its Palestinian neighbours in the false belief that conflicts and wars will bring them prosperity On the contrary it has degraded Israel to a state that uses an apartheidlike policy and mass genocide as justifications for its supremacy Israel is actually a poor yet dangerous country as there is no greater poverty than the lack of ethics morals and humanity
Gaza is governed by HAMAS not Israel Please get the facts right And the West bank is only partially controlled
This is really upsetting to watch Especially when you know Israel denies to westerners their doing genocide or apartheid enragedface 
It is It39s been since the Oslo accords Get over it and stop accusing Israel and attacking Jews for things they are not guilty ofbrbrThe better question is if 39Palestine39 is guilty of apartheid because there39s no Jews allowed there
This angers me so much how dare Israel get a pass on these atrocities
PRO ISREAL
End the brutal occupation and apartheid of the Palestinians now
Yes guilty brDisgustingly blatant
There is no such thing as a Palestinian The Palestinians are a bunch of Syrians Jordanians Lebanese and Egyptians
I wish Za apartheid came back Za is in pieces since the blacks took over
The narration of this video gives me Prager U vibes Very different agendas
APARTHEID IS PERFORMED BY ISLAM AND MUSLIMS AGAINST WOMEN AND OTHER FAITHS 
Don39t act like Palestine was innocent here When the Jews came in they weren39t exactly keen on coexistence either
Short answer yes
They pretend they are Jews and yet theyve forgot about their Torah 10 commandments brbr1 I am the Lord thy god who brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondagebrbr2 Thou shalt have no other gods before Mebrbr3 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vainbrbr4 Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holybrbr5 Honor thy father and thy motherbrbr6 Thou shalt not murderbrbr7 Thou shalt not commit adulterybrbr8 Thou shalt not stealbrbr9 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighborbrbr10 Thou shalt not covet anything that belongs to thy neighbor brbrThey are nothing but thieves murderers and their hypocrisy is above limit
Many many many things wrong with this video What39s going on in Gaza isn39t apartheid They have a selfelected government in Hamas which controls them Not the Israeli government Yes Israel has a blockade at the border but they also let in thousands of Palestinians every day to work inside Israel And of course you need a blockade for security reasons You say Israel controls the resources that go into Gaza but no one ever asks why Hamas doesn39t invest in say desalination plants and produce their own water etc I sturggle to understand why this sort of narrative keeps getting pushed where Israel is at fault for everything but no one seems to point the finger at HAMAS who is solely responsible for the plight of the Gazans
well that explains their promotion of duel citizenship cant afford to lose the apperance of a large israeli majority facewithopenmouth 
Havent watched the video but given it was presented by AJ we already know what the conclusion will be Has AJ ever retracted the claim that Israel was responsible for the Al Shifa bombing
Pure BS Israel is a diverse society Most muslim states on the other hand have ethnically cleansed themselves Certainly no Jews allowed and no Christians either The plight of the socalled Palestinians is entirely their own doing since as everyone knows their first principle is the eradication of Israel
IsraelPalestine not guilty of inbreeding 
No video no apartheid brOne state solution Palestine
This video is no true and spredse false information2 mnilion Arabs live in in Israel check you sources before you spred false info  shame on you 
It was a good video but they talk about a constitution I thought Isreal didnt have one  You say the areas are occupied Israeli s claim they are not can you go through that definition and fact analysis  You say Isreal controls water and power etc in those areas Isreal claims they are being generous Gaza for example could use recourses to build infrastructure like this but put everything towards military tunnels etc  Is that true  I hear accounts obviously from both sides hopefully you can answer these questions
This is complete garbage I don39t even know where to start She claims that Israel controls Gaza This is laughable use some common sense She admits there have been no Israelis in Gaza since 2005 How can Israel control Gaza with no citizens and no troops there Hamas has governed Gaza since 2006 They control everything including all the billions of dollars in aid money that the world gives to Gaza Instead of using the money to help the people of Gaza Hamas used the money to do three things 1 Line the pockets of the leaders 2 Build tunnels 3 Buy weapons to attack Israel brbrThere is no free speech in Gaza If you speak out against Hamas you will most likely be jailed or killed Anyway I could go on all day Pretty much everything in this video is lies and halftruths
biggest bs ive ever heard skull 
Brings back memories the blacks in South Africa
Worse than an apartheid
People have started knowing the tip of the iceberg of what had been going on in Palastine for 75 yearsPeople have been fed with lies all along Zionists succeeded in hiding all this throughout

Ignorant children Whatever happened to the water cannons
Hamas is the true oppressors People who are screaming for peace and a two state solution need to understand theyve been offered that many times in the past They dont want it What they want is to wipe out all the Jews Why someone would support that is beyond me
We live in a double standards country  o e for the Israeli and one for all others even peace loving Jewish people protested the killing and get arrested  We live in a police state controlled media and we have some corrupt  politicians that are not held accountable but regular people go to jail everyday for minor things
You guys Palestine protesters in a democratic country who engage in riots and destroy others39 livelihoods are no better than the Israelis government If you are vocal about it why don39t you have the courage to go to Gaza and join Hamas to fight against Israel instead of protesting on the streets Not only protest but also set fires and destroy other people39s premises and livelihoods
br
brIt39s ironic when you protest against Israelis government but no one mentions last year the massacre and harming those Israelis What have those people done to deserve such treatment Are they not human beings like those people suffering in Gaza right now
br
brLastly what39s amusing is when people from certain countries form groups like Houthis or Hamaz to fight against the West and their government then distance themselves from the country except providing funding for the fighting It is clear this way this way they can make excuses claiming it wasn39t them and it doesn39t represent their country preventing retaliation from the West Unlike North Korea DPRK whose leader has the courage to speak up for their actions Now this is call gutsy unlike those gutless and coward nations leaders   
br
brOn the other hand it would be interesting to find out what those leaders from countries like Iran and Russia along with their propaganda comrades would say if the West did the same and formed groups fight against them and saying it39s wasn39t represented the country  Can the west or other nations do the same  Clearly notSuch a double standard as what the CCP said 
br
brIsrael government may not be right involve with the bombing etc but those fighters should say the country army in Palestine or Iran are no better
This student have nothing with situations they need to be in class We are adding to the last day which was in the Bible Prophecy

The same is happening to a much lesser degree up here in Canada too At least those students are being allowed to communicate to one another outside by holding up signs and while talking to one another maybe too loud for some people next to them to hear however at least they are not being coerced into having to help manufacture bombs bullets cigars etc I hope they all pass their university courses no matter what side they picked to be on outside there at the time instead of later ending up having to do the other manufacturing for the military sort of thing in order for them to make a more decent living instead of worse  Ending up being coerced into having to work in the prostitution industry or else
Both sides are at fault tho most act like hamas is so innocent remember Israel didnt start the war hamas did im not with either side i personally think this war should come to a end too many innocent casualties on both sides

Trust in Jesus today as your savior from hell Christ is the only solution to the sin problem in our world and the eternal penalty as a result which is ultimately part of our nature passed down from adam and eve due to their rebellion against God The good news is that there is a savior from the penalty of sin that God the father sent and that is his only Son Jesus Christ born of a virgin and without a sin nature like the rest of mankind The father established the Old Testament law which was morally perfect to show man39s imperfection in attempting to keep it But Jesus being perfect kept the law perfectly thus fulfilling the law However he didnt just fulfill the law he also died on the cross as a substitute for all mankind39s sin The penalty for sin is death so God sent his own son to pay the penalty for Mankind so we dont have to go to hell The lake of fire is referred to as quoteternalspiritual deathquot so when Christ died for you and me he satisfied the father39s wrath against our sin Afterwards he was buried and then rose again after 3 days conquering the grave  He did this so that mankind can recieve eternal life as a free gift all you have to do is believe it was done for you The gospel of john states quotHe that believeth on the son hath everlasting life but he that believeth NOT the son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on himquot Believe in the original Greek language translates to quotpistueoquot which means to entrust in this case to entrust ones eternal destination to Christ Ephesians 289 quotfor by grace you have been saved through faith and not of yourselves it is a GIFT of God Not of works lest anyman should boastquot Simply believe what Christ already did for you to receive eternal life

If Egypt takes back their Muslim people who are The Muslim Palestinians They won39t be in a War zone acting as human Shields will they   Blame Egypt for closing the border on Hagar and Ismaels children who came from Egypt
The Muslim Palestinians are Egyptians from Hagar and Ismael Egypt has been reluctant to take back their own people
One Palestinian Muslim in Gaza Israel is too many 
Gaza Israel has certainly vomited out the Palestinian Muslims   Hager and Ismael came from Egypt and that39s where they will return to
The Muslim Palestinians don39t have a country anymore and they have the nerve to talk about good faith  Insanity   The Muslim Palestinians have forfeited Gaza back to Israel under The Land for Peace agreement They have no country anymore Hager and Ismael came from Egypt and that39s where they belong Or to one of the other 7 Arab Muslim Nations to live

Is FOX NEWS now in the half truth reporting business Israel cannot make any compromising deal to get the hostages because if they do every Israeli citizen would become the new Middle East Currency all the any terrorist group has to do is to capture Israeli civilians to get any deal they want and in regards to the aid for Palestinians food shortage has been exacerbated by Hamas hoarding of food fuel and medicine as much as 25 of the supplies entering Gaza are  been take by Hamas we all seen the videos and report so why Fox is not talking about it
quotPalestinianquot death toll is the count as given by Hamas  quotPalestiniansquot are terroristsbrKeep that in mind before you start phrasing crap that is terrorist propaganda  There will NEVER be Hamas or ltinsert terrorist group name heregt in the Gaza strip again
TRUMP IN 2024
Israel occupied the Palestinians 75 years ago Why do the Jews pretend to be victims when the whole world sees how the Israelis behave violently towards the Palestinians The Gaza ghetto under Israeli control was completely demolished by Israeli bombs The IDF killed 29000 Palestinians in Gaza Entire families were buried under the rubble people were driven south to Rafah and were told that it was a safe zone However bombs are also thrown at Rafah In the West Bank the police arrest Palestinians every day including women and children Thousands of Palestinians are in detention Israeli illegal settlers are stealing land from Palestinians burning their houses driving them out of their homes The apartheid state of Israel can only survive if it destroys the Palestinians
Israel is killing the innocents of gaza and isreal is very cruel and they dont have any ethics
I guess the number of Palestinians Sinwar wants to be killed hasn39t  been reached But he lives with his family in a tunnel

maybe if israel stopped blocking food trucks

Genocide In the UkraineRussia war we never saw Russia nor Ukraine soldiers attack children and women But Israel  THOUSAND PALASTINIAN CHILDREN killed in just a few days Clearly Ethnic Cleansing is never about Hamas
Can you please for the sake of humanity and truth and facts separate out the  of Hamas terrorist deaths from civilians This is the most basic requirement when reporting on any conflict worldwide Why this basic fact is missing from every single western media outlet is shocking irresponsible and directly supports and promotes motivates and legitimizes terror groups worldwide and Hamas specifically in this conflict I expect Hamas to lie as they always do as well has the Hamas controlled health ministry as well as all these Hamas compromised NGOs But never did I expect this to be adopted by every news channel without any concern for this huge important fact that is not only your job but also your obligation DO BETTER Please Now
You lot in the media really need to quit pretending those who are 39still in the area39 are not Hamas soldiers Get real

There are 100 of drunks sitting at the boarder and the UNRWA organization and others have not been able to keep up with it This is unfortunate but wrong information Hamas is additionally trying to get hold of the deliveries and taking his share before he feeds the starving Palestinians Shame on Fox
So much for the quotthou shall not killquot and for quotthe chosenquot people living as an examplary people after revenge murdering 20000 women and children in Palestine Might be quicker if they just build showers versus forced starvation  NO AID TO ISRAEL STOP THE GENOCIDE
I39m oh so broken up about these Gazans who voted for and supported their terrorist masters and are now paying the price They39re actually lucky it39s the IDF they39re up against If it was Jordan39s king or Syrian dictator Assad they were up against there39d be 100k Gazans dead by now if not more  How do I know Read the history of Black September in 1970 and the Syrian civil war that began in 2015 The Arabs have no sympathy for their enemies especially when it39s their own kind they39re up against
hamas a gangster gang  Men who hate women life children
Gof bless  Isreal
Yes the United Nations is corrupt
Dont give gifts to people who wish to do you harmbrRemember Battlestar Galactica 
Hamas leaders are living in luxury abroad Why are they not feeding the Palestinians who voted them in
29k 20k of those are terrorists
there are 500 trucks just sitting in Gaza and aid agencies have not been able to distribute that aid Israel has no limits on aid to Gaza
How can you possibly believe and stupidly quote Hamas figures
How about Hamas surrenders and hands over the hostages  Don39t we think that that may stop the casualties of war Something that seems to have escaped a lot of wandering minds
Anchor woman says viewers are concerned about humanitarian aid for Gazans This viewer is concerned about the lack of humanitarian aidincluding much needed medicinefor the hostages Why don39t you ask about that humanitarian aid anchor woman
We destroyed the Nazis because they were racial supremacists and they were exterminating people that they didn39t want in their country now the entire world is watching these racial supremacists doing the exact same thing to the Palestinians WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE THERE IS NONE

Good girl
I was born in and live in Australia but my great grandfather fled the April 9th massacre in 1948 His child my great uncle whos 80 or 81 can remember it from when he was 5 years old He was being placed with his siblings in the boot of their car with a mattress positioned over them to help stop the bullets Thats how desperate the situation was I dont like Hamas because theyre beliefs and actions in general and on October 7th are terroristic however I definitely dont like the IDF or as I like to call it the Israeli Devastation Force eitherbrbrFree Palestine PalestinianTerritories

Plot twist the karen is a indian
All good people Israeli people is a good man is a good everybody good
All the inhabitants of the land of Palestine including Muslims Jews Christians Jewish Samaritans and others coexisted there for several centuries Several empires and kings passed through this region their religions were different their states fell their authority was gone and none of them ever abandoned their original inhabitants The evidence is that all the churches of Palestine are still the same including the Church of the Resurrection  It has been like this since the time of Jesus peace be upon him and history did not mention that thing or that anyone abandoned someone because he changed his religion until the announcement of the establishment of the Jewish State of Israel in 1948 Since then everyone has been bleeding from all religions so you must stand on the right side and expand your circle of knowledge
We need peace for once
