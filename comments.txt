What before that 😢what happened after 😅 where are we going with this
This is incorrect. Israel only declared the small area just 657th in size compared to the area held by the muslims bation surrounding israels land just 90 miles north and south by 20 miles east and west. Palistine is a name given the region by the Romans.
no
Free Palestine
If the Arabs lay down their arms, there will be no more war. If Israel lays down its arms, there will be no more State of Israel.
There are Arabs in Israel living alongside Jews, Christians, Muslims, Bedouins, Druze, All are different Arabs. Who are the Palestinians!?
This is islam vs judaism. The last great holy war.
Alot of comments blaming UK &gt;Get your head out the past&lt;
So Palestine doen&#39;t exist 😂 still they think thay do after loosing 3 wars. amazing
How far has hamas and Israel?
How far?
US <br>UK  <br>the entirety of the modern day West <br>Gaza<br>the Holy Land (Jerusalem)<br>Bethlehem <br>Weimar Germany <br><br>all the same people. all the same suspects. all the same problems.
In israel the jews from Europe are much less than half. In israel there are jews from India, from Ethiopia, from yemen, from irak, from marocco Algeria Tunis and Lydia.
There’s probably a really simple reason against this but disregarding the fact that both sides want the other destroyed wouldn’t a good solution to be using the original British recommendation of separation of the lands allowing both peoples their own lands? Please correct me if I’m wrong but it just seems so simple that it feels strange it wasn’t taken into considerations during any peace negotiations (as far as I know).
So basically if Arab had allowed the Israelis to live in peace the Arab-Israieli war wouldn&#39;t have happened and Israel wouldn&#39;t have taken Palestinian land
What&#39;s time title of the piano pice in this video that starts from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYZjOuUnlU&amp;t=135">2:15</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYZjOuUnlU&amp;t=229">3:49</a>
The Farhud in irak took place in 1941, the Trital in marocco took place in 1912. The jews in the arabs countries lived there for generations, unlike the srabs in palestina. A distinction  must be made between the arabs who lived in the west bank who really lived there for generations and the arabs who immigrated to the territory of 1948, who immigrated from arabs countries during the ottoman period, most of them from the end of the 19h century.

Guys ho care about Israel don’t watch it
So,<br><br>Israel gave Gaza back <br><br>And look what Gaza did in 16 years 😂 <br><br>You learn from history <br><br>Don’t give land back!
Free Palestine
First of all, most the jews who live in israel today came from arabs countries. It is true that most jews in the world are jews from Europe, but in israel most jews came from arabs countries. They suffered pogroms and humiliations there, saw the Farhud in irak, see the Trital in marocco in the city of Fez, pogroms in Libya, Algeria and yemen. As for the jews who came from Europe,  they are now a minority  in israel, and there are many who mixed with jews from arabs countries. From a genetic point of view, today it can be determined that the Ashkenazi jews have between 15% to 45% of their origin from the middle East and the rest from southern Italy and only a little north Europe, 15% - 25%.
Free Palestine <br>Who agrees
genuine questions: how do ppl in that territorry tell palestinians ans israeli ppl apart? and hmm both sides are bombing their own territory? and how are more palestinians diying if teveryone is mixed up? ç.ç
every time I try to understand this I find it super confusing.... <br>I have to keep track of a few religions, a few geographic regions, a few governments and a terrorist group  ç.ç
you are good liar actually i would scam if i didn&#39;t study history about israel goals and what made british sell palestine to some jews
There is WAY more context if you go back farther, not just covering the most recent activities.
You are skipping the issue of Jordan. This was also part of the Palestine Mandate.
Your maps have some error. The British mandate for Palestine included Transjordan current kingdom of Jordan. It was only when the Ishemites lost their territories in Saudi Arabia that the state of Jordan was give to the Ishaemite dynasty.
Palestine ❤
Its not about land!!!!!  Nobody has a nation that gets excited about murder.  If that happened in America...you,re done
so is it basically a war that started based on hatred towards another&#39;s religion?
This is NOT a war about land or occupation. This is a war of ideology. Palestinians still believe that Israel needs to be removed from the land. until that ends all the side issues like occupation, settlers, Jerusalem etc are irrelevant until the ideology changes.  Its the unfortunate truth
when you say many jews were expelled from Arab countries, its safe to say at least 700,000 were ethically cleansed from the countries they were born in and lived
Another thing, when britain received the mandate over the region,  it divided palestina into two parts. The eastern part gave to the Hashemite family from Saudi arabia in exchange for their help in first world war. This is how the state of jordan was created, which is actually part of palestina. Most of the Jordanians are palastinian.
During the ottoman rule, the entire area that is now syria, jordan and israel was called syria palestina. and there were no borders. the Arabs called themselves arabs not palestinian. They considered themselves part of big syria.  See the sies pico agreement from 1916 which divided  the territory between Fran and britain. and created new countries. See olso the agreement from the Paris peace conference of 1919 in which the arabs and the jews agreed on a Jewish state where Israel today includes the west bank. and the will receive a large arab state where today syria and jordan. The agreement failed only when the arab learned that syria had been given to france in sies pico agreement.
It need to be corrected, most the arabs did not live for generations in the territory of the 1948 borders. When the jews settled in 1882, most of the Texas uninhabitable, there were many diseases such as malaria. The jews dry swamps and made the area habitable. Most of the Arabs arrived in the area later when the place developed.
Thanks for such comprehensive assessment for a very long conflict have been established over 75 years of oppression. My concern as follows: <br>1- UK is the starting driver in  through conflict and started by Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British Government in 1917 during the First World War announcing its support for establishing Jewish community in Palastein. At that time total Jewish expelled from Europe was 50K while palastenian were 650K. <br><br>Europe expelling unwanted Jewish to settle them away. <br><br>2- October war <br>3- President sadat role in restoring Egyptian land and proposing the first two state solution in 1977 in Camb David treaty. <br><br>Finally, Uk start the bad vision , Kick Jewish from Europe , USA maintain the support and American tax payers will finance the project for ever.

While the timeline and events are accurate there is a lot of opinion in this video.
I don&#39;t support anybody. I support peace. countries shouldnt support anyone. They should support peace. Its the only way.
This report is Antisemitic pro Arabs😂 This channel most probably funded by Qatar Iran 😂
from religion to region
Please grant victory to our people in palestine
No words could describe the horror that came.
This video should be shown to anyone who thinks this started on Oct 7
All started when these arabs rejected the UN plan. When Jews fought back and they lost, they now cry.
The background music is too loud.
Many mistakes, to name a few:  in 1967 Israel and the Arabs did not ‘fight a war’.  Israel attacked its neighbours and stole their lands.  And you forgot to mention that in 73 Egypt and Syria fought back and destroyed the Israel Barliev defence on the Suez canal resulting in a cease fire and then the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.  Hamas was funded by Netanyahu to create a division in the Palestinian authority, by his own admission.
A very important reason,United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine.The United States and Western countries, as well as the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, agreed to this proposal, while all Arab countries opposed it, and China and Britain abstained. The controversial proposal was passed with a vote of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYZjOuUnlU&amp;t=1993">33:13</a>, allowing for the establishment of the state of Israel.
RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES: The Koran celebrates and glorifies the massacre of the Jewish tribe that inhabited the Arabian Peninsula at the beginning of Islam, a massacre led and carried out by Muhammad himself. But Muslims don&#39;t tell you about those religious differences.
More than this, the Palestinians have been suffering for more than 70 years: killing, displacement, seizing their lands, and displacing them. I challenge you to give us how many civilians were killed by Hamas. As for the Palestinian civilian victims, children, women, and the elderly, who were exterminated by barbaric bombing Israeli terrorist numbers in the tens of thousands.
israel offered a part of land to palestine. that&#39;s proof of the occupation😂
Look up the sykes picot aggrement its really why the middle east is in its state today
You go back only 100 years???? Haha wow, as if I needed more of a clue that this video is a complete joke!
israeLIES again and again
interesante
STOP BRINING FIRE AGAINST ISRAELIS AND JEWS AROUND THE WORLD BC OF JEWISH SETTLERS IN THE WEST BANK, THEY ARE NOT A PART OF OUR AGENDA
1) it goes much before the beginning of 19th century<br>2) arabs were a minority in israel before the 19th century <br>3)tension between jews and arabs was not the reason for the brits to stop jewish immigration but rather the quick pace in which they built new villages in areas were NO ONE LIVED and from SCRATCH <br>4)  assuming jews are Europeans is incorrect and not a good reason for the mass murder of jews by muslim arabs all over arab countries due to the establishment of the jewish state. <br>5)   The “expelled” arabs were able to return back home but decided not to. Just as today, even israelis in a war zone are evacuated from their homes- including mr. Hadid and his family! .do not mislead.
free israel
free palestine
I&#39;m assuming that if the Native Americans decide to  &quot;come home&quot; (United States), non-natives will move gladly into a walled-off prison of a city, totally reliant on others for day to day life. I mean, it WAS their original homeland FAR longer than that of the invading Britains/Europeans.
As sad as it is I don&#39;t think this conflict will ever end well one side will probably destroy the other
Excellent video, especially showing the settlements in the West Bank
zer gut
Palestina fue filistea y ocupo la tierra primero.  Los Romanos quemaron todas las cronológicas judías en el 70EC. Después de eso nadie puede alegar que es judio.
You can get anything you want at Alice’s restaurant
&quot;This earth is not my home. I&#39;m just a passing through.&quot;  .. They&#39;re home now; they&#39;re back.. 💔❤✝
the ottoman empire wasn’t allowing people to live peacefully how can you ignore the Armenian genocide
There wars somewhere, theA I we all use now  cost millions  of lives in the congo, the Dimonds jewellery  costs many lifes, that  is the nature of humans,  that wont change for a long time😮
And the British live in peace, while the Arabs n Palestin and Jews have to suffer their earlier mistake
The British created this genocide by giving Jews land that didn’t belong to them! Why isn’t anyone calling out the so called king and British prime minister to correct their mistake!
I&#39;m sorry but the word Israel appears I&#39;m the Quran like eighty times....judeha is the land of the Jews and older than the Muslim religion itself most phillastines which is what the are are Jordean Iraqi and Egyptian
What? It doesn’t only go back to 1900’s 😂 it goes back for almost 2000 years lol king Saul and king Solomon…the three who settled ancient gaza the banks and I sort of forgot the other settlement but this conflict goes back a few thousand years not just 1900’s

It’s interesting how Vox keeps using words like “violent” to describe Palestine efforts but Israel’s violence against them as “containment”.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 from both Israel and Hamas
من النهر إلى البحر, נהר לים,
another video with no mention of nakba (530 villages destroyed and 15,000 palestinians killed) which happened prior to israel-arab war. use your own skills to search stuff, these youtube videos would never be biasless
Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and Joe biden
You lost me at &quot;It only goes back about a century.&quot;
the 2nd holocaust is happening in palestine rn to palestine
look. did u no that in the jews book it says they cannot have a land (country)
. . .
Free Palestine from the river to the see from occupation, oppression and colonisation
You keep running your mouth without any proof just to get some views Be shameful
I cant find any scource citations for this video. Anybody know where I can find some?
Hmmmmm so the British are to blame?
Liberals didn’t care about any of this until recently 💀
Forgot to say that israel had the land for thousands of years before the romans crushed them and named the area palestine literally meaning invader foriegner
Much worse for who????? <br><br>Maybe you should do a better job at clarifying your closing statements rather than leave it open to interpretation when you already know the answer.
Excerpts from the documentary &quot;The Human Factor (2019)&quot; directly from the mouths of the US officials who worked in Clinton administration to broker the so called &quot;Deal&quot; to Palestinie/Arafat: <br><br>&quot;as a fulfillment of Arafat&#39;s worst fears, that Barak and Clinton were ganging up to impose a deal on him.<br><br>We are determined to do our best.<br><br>Look, let&#39;s be clear.<br>And I&#39;ll put this right on the table.<br><br>If an honest broker means that here are the two sides, my left hand and my right hand, and an honest broker essentially means you adopt positions in the middle, that&#39;s not the United States.<br><br>We have rarely played that role.<br><br>In fact, the Americans&#39; negotiating philosophy has been the United States coordinates positions with Israel, finds out how far Israel can go, and then tries to market that<br>outcome to the Palestinians.<br><br>Now, if you&#39;re a Palestinian, you have to ask yourself, &quot;Why do I want the United States in the room?&quot;<br><br>Since all the United States is doing is, in Aaron Miller&#39;s words, &quot;acting as Israel&#39;s lawyer.&quot;<br><br>I know a lawyer when I see one.<br><br>And too many people<br>in the Clinton administration, myself included, functioned far too frequently as Israel&#39;s lawyer during these negotiations.<br><br>Did we have a Palestinian lawyer on our team?
That was quite a balanced objective video 👍
I&#39;m starting to get frustrated because of those people who make videos like israel vs palestine, israel is where jesus came from, and all you do is hate israel?! You dissapoint me.
Why was the Yom Kipper war of 1973 left out of this brief history?
I hate America
Now this is what I call real History 👏🏻 Nothing but Facts
So the Arabs were the first to attack? Got it lol
England gave land that was never theirs
This is bias to the oppressors, the Zionists 😢 shame on you
In 1947, the Arab State was created when Palestine was divided into 2 states.  When did the Arab State cease to exist?
Even Aliens are amazed.
Name Palestinians was coined with human , people used to terrifying Israel because of their faith
Yall are saying <br>👇Isreal👇   👇palestine👇<br>But I say 🖕 all religions. 90% of all wars start because of religion so stop believing in fairy tales
Israel is bomming Palestine for no reason and also they want Palestinian land
Palestine does not exist and will never exist❗❗❗❗
I think it’s time for all the Christian countries to help Israel
In summary, religion is poison.
Civilian by day, green bands by night: Unmasking the truth in plain sight.
Basically Palestine got greedy and tried to forcefully take more land and lost that battle. In turn they ended up with less than what was given to them. They keep it up and they won’t have anything. Don’t start none won’t be none. I don’t have a dog in this fight. Im just stating what I observed in this video.
I feel like the age of the arab conquest was perfect timing because we now all think egypt and israel etc  are native to the arabic people.
It is not an Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it&#39;s instead an Israeli occupation of the Palestinian land
The accurate title : How the Israeli Occupation on Palestinian Began
It still doesn&#39;t make sense <br>Why are Muslims blowing them selfs up in jihad ?<br>If all 3 religions want to worship a wall why fight eachother if we as a human race carnt decide on being peacefully with oneanother they all should leave that area Muslims should move away to mislim countrys Jewish should move to Israel and if they need more land to expand they should buy or make a deal with jordan christians need to move to Christian country&#39;s, then divide the year up so all religious can worship without any trouble.<br><br>From my point of view if the christian / catholic countrys all have major weapons bombs ect jewish and muslims will all die in a genocide...<br>We all seen what happened during ww2 everyone has witnessed the horrific events in iraq Germany we all know that kind of blood on your hands is the devils work.<br><br>Yet Muslims and Jewish have been at it non stop from what i can see its pathetic
How do people think Palestine is in the right?
A lot of facts are missing here...can&#39;t claim that this is unbiased
Your history ,(religious) is incorrect in regards to the jews
Islam does not date back 4000 years it literally came out 1400 years ago making it a very recent religion
❤
So Palestine was Israel  land at that time
A few thousand years. Blatentent wrong history implying islam is an ancient religion.
So much lie in one small vidoe. It was Palestinian land and US got to decide for them?  US is big enough why didn’t they give Jewish people some of their land? Why Palestinian people had to give their land? Israel is commuting a genocide right now (2024). They killed 15,000+kids and total of more than 30,000 in last 4 months. Tired of watching those bias history explanation. Go follow bisan or motaz, they are journalists who are currently reporting from Gaza, Palestine.
I am not surprised by this biased report, fortunately nowadays, the world can see through this bias. <br><br>What happened to Palestinians is straight up Colonization
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bno1m1zhIWs&amp;t=210">3:30</a> you don’t mention the 400+ massacres comitted against the Palestinians
Some important details omitted. 1948 partition plan was allocating 55 percent of the mostly fertile land to the Jewish MINORITY,… rather than negotiating down with the NATIVE population, the deal only worsened
USA, Britishers And Egyptians are the only Problem creaters in world!
Palestine are bullies Israel are holy islam is the antichrist christianity is good isalm bad full stop
This is such a complex history, with so much trauma to the people on both sides.  It is a reminder that hate breeds more hate, unfortunately. I pray for peace, and healing on both sides.
So, that&#39;s the Palestinian Land, no any Israel.<br>Romans, greeks and others lived here in the Western Balkans, maybe they also have right on our, slaws land ? But no, that is not even on their minds... Why the west havent give the german land to jews, they deserved that after the holocaust ?
So much missing information
Israel is the 12 sons all black people
For anyone who thinks this video is somehow biased because of all the details they left out. This video left out atrocities carried out by BOTH sides, not just one. Just because the video is not explicitly supporting your narrative doesn’t mean it’s biased. As neutral of a take as it gets.
before Muslims there was Palestine ruled by Christians and Jewish arabs, not the European invaders.
Islam is always bad anyway
There are very very few people if any that are true JEWS. When GOD separate the people GOD said he would NO LONGER BE WITH THE PEOPLE. HE gave his word to the , CHRISTIANS AS THEY HAD READ AND ACCEPT JESUS AS THE MESSIAH.. IF YOU BOTHER TO READ THE BIBLE, YOU WILL SEE THIS PLAIN AS DAY. , AS FAR AS PALESTINE . THERE IS , AND NEVER HAS BEEN A PERSONAL GROUP OF PEOPLE. The Palestinians are people  from all over the known world at that time. there is NO SUCH PEOPLE! The people who live there are from HAM, so if you follow all the people from HAM , THEN YOU WILL KNOW WHY , and what is happing in ISAREL AND PALESTINE&#39;
Jesus as died for the sins of the world accept him today God is coming again to Judge the earth ,in Christ Jesus lays all hope for siner Jesus saves the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand :repent ye and believe the Gospel
Ask why have Jews been targeted through out life ?
Imagine if it was some random land not considered &quot;holy.&quot; Probably the borders would have been drawn and that would be the end of that.
Thank you.
God bless the Jews.
God Save Israel
Calling the 3rd holiest mosque for muslims a temple is unbiased yes seams fair
How&#39;s Israelites became White European ZIONISTS TERRORI..S ? <br>Why UGANDA was ZIONISTS first option to INVENT Israel? <br>Why Israel wasn&#39;t invented in GERMANY ? That&#39;s where they were persecuted TORTURED and COWARD MURDERED. <br>History channel ❓❓❓❓❓

Why is DNA test banned israel. Why do modern israelis have huge amounts european DNA in them if they were the original israelites?
I love how they blurred out the Jewish establishment paper and hid the whole thing including who it was to which was the baron rothschild of the time
Wana know what’s really happening??? Read the bible…‘you’ll be so scared you will $hit your pants
And Christians 30 second in and the incorrect details keep going
Everyone should watch this
No word about zionism? Sure, History
So it’s the United Nations fault for not including the Palestinians in the new border line drawings between Israel and Palestine?
So Palestine sees Israel as a huge state of colonization.
RELIGION PERPETUATES IGNORANCE.
To bad the world can&#39;t stop fighting, for what it&#39;s worth this is what Jesus said, maybe it will work IDK but it&#39;s interesting? I&#39;m just a man but I wish peace for all the world. <br>&quot;<br>37 “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones God’s messengers!

We know how it began. Its  part of world history in which judeans have always acted up and gotten christians to defend them. And obviously christies boyz n gals oblige as best they can
Jews descendants can trace back to One individual,CAIN the original Sinner,the liar whom desobeyed Yhavee When He told Him to bow down before Adam Ben Yehuaa.<br>At that moment The earth was condemned .<br>Thanks You Hebrew ass#&amp;#+.
4000 years ago ?<br>Man it’s not more than 2100 years Christianity and Islam was existed
The 3000 years + background on Jewish people’s land is very shallow and not factually supported in your video;  those are the significant foundational facts to the rest of the video.
I think this shows how many times Isreal has wanted to take over Palestine over and over again.
A brief history of how many times Isreal has caused conflict with Palestine

These types of videos can not be simplified to just this and this happened, you are providing a video full of misinformation just for the purpose of simplifying it
Both Jews and Muslims are advised to not eat pork and to eat clean food we have more similarities than we give ourselves credit for. On The Contrary the state of Israel which is the government not the uninvolved people is not Israeli or Jewish for that matter they hide behind that name to hide what they really are which is zionists and are from the synagogue of satan Religious Orthodox Jews oppose the government and the state and politics just like their Religious Traditional Islamic Brethren.
how can we be so sure that this is the accurate version of the history of the region, Napoleeon Bonaprte once said what if history is a fable that we have all agreed upon with that being said it would be nice if jews and muslims could get along for once we are cousins if not brothers after all Prophet Abraham Pbuh had two sons Prophet Issac Pbuh and Prophet Ishmael Pbuh Jews descend from  Issac  and Arabs descend from  Ishamel.

Also what he should of mentioned that Israel use to be called judeae in the old Roman time, which was place where Jewish people lived, yes years went on and the state of Israel was named but it was still the nation of hebrew
Its funny when Muslims try to twist history ☠️
Hiatory channel: owned by zionists
Just let Islam destroy what they say in Quran. Since their Allah wants them to do it, it must be the right thing to do
How about this. We give the Palestinians their land back, and you live under their state. If you say no, then you probably haven&#39;t been stating right. Scared to undergo because of how you have treated them. But I guarantee they would forgive you and offer you peace of mind living.
For everyone who wants to know how this conflict started!!!, read about the Tantura massacre/Tantura movie, and you will know how Israel steal from Palestine&#39;s land.
This is accurate
If people could read a bible more often they all would understand that it wont make any sense to fight for any land and to understand that the world is big enough for us all to live on it in peace
How can you claim something by destroying it into pieces ? 🤔
But the same Jewish asked for Jesus to be crucified ? Doesnt make any sense and since when does Allah/Jehovah God want innocent civillians to be slaughter for a land ?
Free Palestine from bad jews 🇵🇸
Im just trying to understand why everyone keeps spamming “Free Palestine 👇”
Not bad for a 6 minute summary. Pro Palestine people still do not like this narrative I guess since it must be about Palestine being victim only, and all the killings and attacks are justified in their mind
Who is here in 2024?!
That’s the problem!! You’re calling it a conflict like it’s fair, even,or legal in any way.. the Parisians are hostages in their own country!  Israel is an illegal occupation!  It’s an illegal settlement.    Let’s start with that.
It&#39;s real easy folks! Live in peace ✌ or &quot;Rest in peace&quot;.
Thank you History Channel for your excellent retelling of history as it really began, right up to the present time. I needed to know this information very much.
Moral of the story; Never let the west draw borders.
Watching this in 2024, would watch again
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bno1m1zhIWs&amp;t=149">2:29</a> In 1947 The United Nations (entities with no connection to the land of palestine) decided to partition the state of palestine into two countries the jewish state of israel and the arab state of palestine, Israel agree. Palestine didnt. CONFLICT BEGINS!
As an American this is the reason why I don’t trust any country from that area (middle East )Muslims, Christians, or any religion. It feels like the cultures are breeding mental illness like crazy. And we don’t want it to spread into any of our countries . All I see is war from you guys there… Why can’t you just get along?🙄
Brilliant Work... Thank you...
She mentioned “the catastrophe” without actually telling us what happened during that time…Palestinians were forcibly removed from their homes. If they resisted, they were murdered. Kind of like what’s happening now…

The God and prophet of Christianity ?? No bihh Jesus is God not a prophet
Did u mention Palestine back then was apart of uk territories
So many mistakes were made before, during and after the Great War that we are still paying for today
In short, it was more a prison escape than an attack. It was like America back when they secluded the natives to reservations only in Israel they caged the population in and torment them so it was a matter of time.
Great analysis! Just a minor error at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0anQIEeLonA&amp;t=587">9:47</a> where she said the PLO &#39;s negotiator was Mahmoud Abbas instead of Yasser Arafat.
???????
What about the Hebrew isrealites  black peoe6
They dont want to be beholden to Israel for their survival, they want to be able to determine their own fate. A fight we will all soon be having as states become more powerful and UBI becomes more common. It has been the fight fought since time immemorial, no one wants to be a slave. Jews just happen to be the scapegoat for this since time immemorial but they suffer  the same fate
Sounds like no one wants to compromise😢
The main problem now seems like the years of oppression of the Palestinians and the West Bank settlements.
The story actually begins when Sarah, whose husband was Abraham, found she was barren and could not produce for him and heir.  She told him to go to Hagar, their servant, to impregnate her and have a child to inherit his legacy.  He did this.  Then God said to Abraham, Sarah is with child, and she was, and Abraham cast out Hagar and their child, Ishmael.
This is the kind of balanced news I&#39;m interesyed to hear.Eell done madam.
Are Palestinians originate from the Ottoman Empire ? Are they Philistine and now called Palestinians ?
Was this also prophesized on revelation?
very good but you talk too fast, you badly slur words. I would share this if it was possible for old people too, please pronounce english words slower.. It would be worth redoing the audio on this with a clearer english speaker, these are important but they are never heard by most Americans due to not having good english. Thanks
The ather country see bouth of you ,when thay currency fall than thay attack on Your country...so that way stop the WAR and live to LOVE...
Plz stop the WAR ,that effect our EARTH 🌎
From religious side of things, we can’t As Christian’s hate the Jews for crucifying Jesus, without the crucifixion of Jesus, we would not be saved
This is not a report based on ANY factual information at all.
Israel you have to pay for the deaths of Palestinian Muslims
Lil bro thinks he is the president of yappingstan
Why is the world letting the bullies of Israel to commit genocide against the poor and vulnerable people of Gaza? Israel is doing worse than what Hitler did to the Jewish. Not only Israel is murdering the poor and vulnerable Palestinian people but they are also destroying their homes.  Israel invaded Palestine with the excuse of finishing with the terrorist group Hamas but they know that they will never be able to do that.  Israel and Russia are bullies, they are committing genocide. Please help the vulnerable people of Gaza and Ukraine
First fact, she got wrong was about Jesus, who is not our prophet. He is our literal savior.
Good explanation  of Israel  vs  palatial<br>Religiously politically and geogaraphly<br>For polititicaly there is no any solution that we found.for make peace to with  them.<br>Both are in one religion some different<br>Both are the Abraham&#39;s generations<br>Both believing one God<br>For both of them one is Judge he is God<br>He may decide and choose which is Wright or wrong<br>God will make solution to them .<br>But <br>Polititicaly they won&#39;t accept this record what I mentioned above.<br><br>We cannot show God to political world.
Can someone ELI5? All these names and times and who and where are making me confused and I can’t focus. I desperately want to understand what’s going on from a non biased point of view.
my big bro sometimes he is annoying but he’s mad fun to play with randomly
I really don’t know which side to pick, it seems like both sides have their own story
Vai para o infer Palestina pelo hebraico digo que: פלשתינה לא יהיה חופשי!!!
Israel are right.
problem will be solved if palestine will accept to co-exist with israel.
FREE PALESTINE🇵🇸
Don’t trust a source that’s gonna skip almost 1200 years of history
Stop it israel 😢🤬🤬🤬🤬😭
Free Palestine Insha, allah
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Thank you for this.
Very true 🙏
Free PALESTINE 🤲🕋🕯️🙏📿🕊️☮️
The Jews arecowards
Thanks for explaining the history.
ALL MUSLIMS MUST ABANDON ISLAM AND START ENJOYING FREEDOM AND HAPPINESS 👍❤️👍
Those are the consequences of Opression. The Israelis are indeed the &quot;Chosen People of God &quot; of the God that they created in their own mental fantasy. There&#39;s No God and no Chosen mentality defected jerks.
God is great, God is great, God is great, God is great, O God, grant victory to our brothers, our families, and our loved ones in Palestine over the criminal Zionist Jews and the criminal Americans. With our soul and blood, we sacrifice for you, O Al-Aqsa. With our blood, we sacrifice for you, O Palestine. Where is humanity, O world? The blood of Gaza is spilled, women are dying, old men are dying,  Children are cut up every day.  The Israeli occupation committed massacres against the poor Palestinian people, deported them from their country, killed millions of people, bombed their homes, killed their parents, children and women, fought with illegal weapons, dropped phosphorus on them, bombed mosques, churches, hospitals and schools with planes.  He committed hundreds, even hundreds, hundreds of massacres against the poor Palestinian people. The Palestinians do not have planes, tanks, or powerful equipment. Israel occupied Palestine and Britain is the one that brought Israel and America supports Israel in everything with powerful weapons to fight Palestine. The Israeli occupation is cutting off electricity and water.  Food and fuel are on Gaza. Israel has a very strong media. Israel denies the truth. The Israeli occupation claims that they are the oppressed. They lie and slander. It fights and besieges the small Gaza Strip. This is not fair. Israel is all terrorism. Gaza is being annihilated by the occupation.  The brutal Israeli, where is the humanity, oh world!  Where are human rights!  Gaza is in danger, Palestine is in danger. We must defend Palestine with everything we have<br>🇵🇸❤🇵🇸❤🇵🇸❤🇵🇸❤🇵🇸❤🇵🇸❤🇵🇸
And yet Palestinians internal corruption and outside indifference continues without any change. Why aren&#39;t the Palestinians supported and assimilated by the other Arab nations who say they care so much about Palestinians so they can live decent lives? Why don&#39;t they help them build Gaza instead of weaponizing them as their tool of war against Israel? Israel is a historically Jewish nation. Why isn&#39;t there a multi-country effort to oust Hamas and return the hostages so the attacks can cease? I wish someone would make a video explaining the obvious questions we all have.
A glaring error: Egypt did not win back the Sinai after the ‘73 war. It was only after negotiating a peace deal with Israel at The camp David accords. Also, I don’t believe Syria was a party to those accords as stated here.
I love palestine you love palestine????<br>👇

Jews that form Israel today, have nothing to do with those that any time of history lived in Palestine. whit Europeans are not from Palestine.
So basically they&#39;re fighting over religion
Investigative evidence and israeli confession has proven thay the music festival murder was carried out by the IDF themselves.
Not surprised. Religion, once again at the heart of a war
Mahathama Gandhi, believer of Hinduism  and Lord Buddha&#39;s teachings, made the British Empire to crumble by using &quot;PAssive Resisitance&quot;, non-violant war. His followeres were Matine Luthar King and Nelson Mandela. Christains and Catholics who came to East later became non-violnt and learnt to  live with the Buddhsit and Hindus peacefully. Even Muslims in Sri Lanka are non-violant(unless they  have other methods). I do not know how peaceful is the preachings of Jew prophats. Do they also beleieve in &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot;. One thing I know is both religions are called Ibrahimic religions(and Christian?). Spanish Catholics have spread the religion in Peru using weapons and Smallpox(brought about by angry Spanish God). That was many years ago. Now they are also peaceful. I am happy to be a practicing Buddhist lived along with Hindus in Sri Lanka allowing Catholics and Muslims to build churches near Buddhst temples.
Ezekiel 38. It’s on
The israelian are not fascist Jews the Palestinians let them come into their and without straight out of the Holocaust after world War 2 . To have  a peaceful place to live but the Israelites got greedy and colonize the country since 1947 and started wars with the cut them off and the chorus of about 7 years they killed many children and had wars with each. Preston and had them in the open which were decent human beings.. for example any prison in the world or in the United States criminals have rights to be treated like human is an international and they also retaliate or fight for their human I do they get Justice to be treated fair.... So what&#39;s the the fascist Jews had them locked up on the open air prison taking the freedom away from them or pressing them fighting wars with them and killing their children and innocent of course I&#39;m going to fight back they&#39;re not terrorist and they were held as an open prison except the big big difference they&#39;re not criminals their innocent civilians in Hamas is fighting for Palestinian country.... The terrorists here are the fascist Israeli Jews.... They&#39;re sick in their mind perverted psychopath...... And to top it off they&#39;re just a bunch of thieves and murdering babies...
Apologies if any offensive comments popped up in my name. I was hacked...😢😢😢
lies
Where all the Muslim country Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Middle East country why are they not helping Palestine 🇵🇸? Why other country Muslim are not sending their army?
Amazing, non-biased explanation of the conflict!!! Thank you!!!
Its not a good explanation at all. It doesnt emphasis the important parts of the conflict. Have you wonder for example why the arab state wasnt establish in 1948? Its because Jordan and Egypt didnt want Palestinian state. Part of the reason because the Palestinian leader was a pro nazi
What have Muslim, Islam, Jihad nations etc done to bring Peace, Joy, Love, Kindness and Mercy to their own peoples?<br>They have done nothing except shared a book that spreads hate, corruption, hypocrisy and murder ww.<br>They cannot hide their bullying terrorist murdering treatment of their own peoples especially their women and those who have seen through the lies and corruption.
More clearer than we are used to hear on this conflit . Thank you
And so that the Muslim Army may deliver as much damage as possible to Dajjal&#39;s Army. The Nur of<br>Allah جل جلاله appeared on my right hand index finger and I keep on fighting Dajjal for a long time with the<br>nur of Allah. MuhammadQasimDreams

Stop war
Stop the war for the sake of your child&#39;s safety.
They are fighting for something that doesnt originally belong to both ppl...
This is nothing compared to what they did in the indies..
History repeat, appreciate the explanation in details.
Palestine was wrong not to agree with resolution 181. It was made by UN and it should just be the law.
Religion is ridicules. I hate it all. Jews believe they are something, Muslims believe they are something. . . But we are all just the same.
Based Romans
Damn good history lesson ….. thank you for being honest
Jews had a homeland when the God of intelligence established the Shekel.

Rest in peace my peoqple
Rest in peace my peoqple
The fascist bias of India, is clear specially as this current government wants to expel any non-hindu from the country and has been encouraging Hindus to go after Muslims and Christians. It&#39;s disgusting
They didn’t mention the Abraham accords….?
Unfortunately I think it skimmed over the parts that made israel look good. So I can’t say it was fair but it is the most pro Palestinian version I’ve seen which I guess is ok.
And so that the Muslim Army may deliver as much damage as possible to Dajjal&#39;s Army. The Nur of<br>Allah جل جلاله appeared on my right hand index finger and I keep on fighting Dajjal for a long time with the<br>nur of Allah. MuhammadQasimDreams
Israel wanted to bring back “Apartheid “ to separate the Israeli from the Palestinians. If the Israeli want to stay away from the Palestinians, then get out of Palestine, go back to Europe or where ever you came from. I don’t want to be around sharks, “so I don’t go to “SharkTown”.
this is ridiculous…. i’m not picking a side. it’s greed on both sides wanting territory
Thanks for the video!
May Allah help palastine
They ask me how much time is left before Qiyamah (The Day of Judgement). I say to them, “When<br>the wars (conflict) begin, which will all be part of World War 3 and Ghazwa tul Hind,<br>MuhammadQasimDreams
Now they’re losing Muslims want to quit.
America terorist
Israel terorist
Very concise and informative. Also i want to mention not all the country given declaration of israel as a state and jewish country. Its just few and now they are conquering to everyone.
You stole from palstine
This was a good description of the conflict, Thanks for that.
The most pressing issue is the status of Jerusalem. I believe a potential solution lies in making Jerusalem the capital of both Israel and Palestine, while explicitly excluding it from serving as the seat of government for either entity. Both Israel and Palestine would have the autonomy to select their respective seats of government, with the stipulation that Jerusalem cannot be chosen for either. This arrangement is not unprecedented. For instance, in the Netherlands, Amsterdam is the capital, but The Hague is the seat of government
Follow the money, you talked about the Balfour declaration but not about who it&#39;s addressed to, Lord Rothschild.
Should I make a video on who should India support?
I am gonna copy this videos link and paste it where someone say free palestine.the real problem is hamas.arad countries agreed for peace Israel agreed and Palestine agreed but hamas wants the war.however Israel should not kill common people and so hamas.fight the armies but hamas don&#39;t agree
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR0DsXH0bT4&amp;t=752">12:32</a> because the partition was 63:37 land wise in favor of israel while palestine had twice the population which is absolutely insane and ridiculous do your research
Also thank you for a accurate history lesson better than most propaganda bs news ❤❤❤<br>Free palestine 🇵🇸
Since you are collecting information from different sources please take time to read only old Testament from Bible... <br><br>You know what is the truth... <br><br>It&#39;s already Propecised about Israel...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR0DsXH0bT4&amp;t=293">4:53</a> wrong <br><br>Judaism is not born on 1948..<br><br>Please read bible old Testament  to know better of Israel...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR0DsXH0bT4&amp;t=191">3:11</a> not migrated.. <br>Jews went to their own land
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR0DsXH0bT4&amp;t=192">3:12</a> wrong ...<br>jews went to their own place israel...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR0DsXH0bT4&amp;t=153">2:33</a> wrong information supposed to say Israel..
It is not Christianity wanted to kill jews but roman catholic who are not true Christians moreover even true Christians were killed by roman Catholics
About mohammad you said regarding Jerusalem is lies around the world..
If the Arabs lay down their arms, there will be no more war. If Israel lays down its arms, there will be no more State of Israel.
Plastilin is The Century&#39;s Anti-Semitism Invention as a Continuity to the 1938 agenda.

Free Palestine...nd stop supporting Israel bi...tch
If trump was In office this wouldn&#39;t have happened
thats why hitler is mad
Then its mean free Palestine not from isreal free Palestine from hamas
Very clarity in thoughts
Wow.mam first time i understand why people hate Jews
Hell with Palestine. Let them rule themselves and you will have a failed state again. No country can truly thrive if they are not willing to put progressivism before Islam.
Israel 🇮🇱 army full support ❤❤❤❤
The Jews suffered from Germany now to Muslims the Jews are the real victims here 😢❤🇮🇱
Well, you say the British brought the Jews to Palestine, and you wonder why the Palestinians are defending their land, and you say we don&#39;t blame Israel. That is really disgusting
Okay, so you compared with the India-Pakistan partition. Let me remind you, when Pakistan was created, India agreed. When Israel was created Palestine didn&#39;t agree with the decision made by UN. If I permit anyone to make his house on my land, it&#39;s legal. If I don&#39;t permit it&#39;s illegal. It&#39;s isn&#39;t that complicated.
Israel occupied palestine and formed israel. It was wrong at the first place
Which country Germany was support
You didn’t quite cover the history of the land. You should start from 4000 years ago, from the ancient kingdom of Israel, to the invasion of roman empire, to renaming Israel to palestine by the romans to the ottoman empire. Jews never left the land. Israel has never been zeroed with Jews to say that they no longer own the land bc more arab muslims are already there due to migration. Put simply, the Jews who were in exile simpy returned to the homeland. They didn’t occupy the land, they returned to their land.
Wrong
I really feel bad for the Palestinian 😢you&#39;ll be good inchallah ❤❤❤
Try to read chapter again ...and if you have any doubts please let me know ...
Fake info ..😅
War is horrible. But Palestine is wrong. <br>Israel attacks Hamas terrorists who hide behind  civilians and use human shields. They also hold captive innocent people. Israels attacks are to attack Hamas Terrorists. Do civilians get hurt? Ofcourse, on both sides. That’s war. There are casualties. Palestine are the ones who want an entire take over of Israel. To wipe out all Israelites. Hence why they say “the occupancy of all Palestine” <br>They don’t want peace. They don’t want any Israel state. <br><br>Tell me where I’m wrong?
Actually historically is real is right It  jews settled the land in place of Canaanites in Bible times way before Muslims in fact Muslims didn&#39;t settle the land until 7th century CE when is real was conquered by the Islamic caliphate

You don&#39;t have any knowledge who&#39;s is right or  who&#39;s wrong
Israel never trully wanted to give palestine their land. Thats why they contantly occupying gaza and west bank.<br><br>Its not the same with india and pakistan. Because india nor pakistan occupying each other. Also India and pakistan has their own army to protect the country, palestine does not have army because Israel does not let have them have one.<br><br>Its not as simple as that. However truth start to unfold and people now wake up to the truth
Bible is never wrong... It&#39;s written in Bible clearly about this war. And it&#39;s happening right infront of our eyes...   Guys it&#39;s coming to an end, be ready for the judgement day...! Jesus loves you all
wow i have watched many videos on this topic but your videos was the best
Israel: tiny home for a small number of Jews, the only Jewish home.<br><br>These people have been kicked and genocided out of so many countries!!<br><br>They created a Jewish homeland and welcomed Muslims into it, as normal citizens.<br><br>Muslim world: <br>&quot;This Israel is disgusting! We refuse to recognise this place as a country.<br>They&#39;re colonizers (as if that&#39;s a bad word).<br>They commit genocide.<br>Kill them all. Every last one.<br>Even the trees and rocks will identify them for us. We are doing God&#39;s work.&quot;<br><br>Muslims: Send and pay for terrorists to murder Israeli civilians and destroy the country.<br><br>Israelis: Make the desert scrap of the worst land into a rich nation with plenty of food and greenery. Democracy. Powers Silicon Valley. Wins wars against numerous, vastly larger enemies in days. Suffers constant attacks from terrorists when they&#39;re just trying to exist (with Jews, Muslims, Christians, non-religious people all in the same country).<br><br>Media: Israelis are the bad guys.<br><br>Universities: Israelis are the bad guys.
JUST STOP THE WAR ......just pls stopp🥺🥺🥺🥺 plssssss im begging🥺🥺🥺🥺the kids are dying
Thank you!
Can’t even say israel correctly lmao
You have a very nuanced perspective for sure. BUT I must say you shouldn’t blame Palestine for waging war against Israel in 1948. This is because of the fact that the partition HEAVILY and UNFAIRLY favored Israel and gave away astronomically too much  land that rightfully belonged to Palestine. The partition gave Israel the implied right to displace and kick out millions of Palestinians from their homes. They had no choice but to fight back and wage war. Really I think Palestine’s biggest mistake was electing hamas. But it’s difficult to blame them fully when it seems like occupation and terror against their people will never end. They are truly desperate.
then let me give you an example imagine you are happily living in your house one day a stranger come to your house as of your kind heart you showed him hospitality but after somedays he met your father and requested for a space in your house and your father had just partitioned your room with him (as un divided israel and palestine) without liking your dads decission you started up fighting with him in order tp claim the area he had taken from you but he is also not in cooperation to give you back your land and day after day he slowly s😮tarted stealing your things and because of this your mother had made peace treaty with him (as pL made ) but in the end ypur mind is not satisfied with it  and for many years you are suffering from the air attacks and land attacks made by him whenever you reach your father(UN) he the stranger just agree to him and within 2 &#39;3 days he continue what je was doing and day by day they are killing innocents in the name of killing terrorists (just look at motaz azaizas videos for what israel is really doing on them ) and one day you after the continuos disturbance from him you decided to fight against him with all the rage you had been holding in your mind and that was a special day to him and because of this the world stand against you and they forget what he had did to you in masjidul aqsa while you were praying for many decades he had even killed many of your people and after you took a decision the world started blaming you and a women sitting in a chair with bunch of expression packed gace is trying to twist the story in favour to israel how will you feel??? ( from river to sea palestine will be free)
anti- indians only call india as bharat
You can&#39;t compare israel- palestine with india and Pakistan...israel occupied someone&#39;s country...but who were the ppl of india created a seperate nation and named as pakistan.
Why are you calling india as Bharat?<br><br>Why don&#39;t you keep your real name in youtube as &quot;Sangi keerthi history &quot;
The video yu have posted abt israelis @9.35 is the video of wounded Palestinians
I personally think that because Palestine lost their land in a conflict they started themselves, they have no right to come back and claim that land. They&#39;re victims of their own poor leadership and bad decisions.
israel is still killin palastinien kids and women a child has been hung decapitated recently by israel
you missed a lot of part in between israel reallty did injustes to the palastiniens who welcomed them at the time of there hardship
good explained
Your history is absolute bluff.. That land already with isreal
Not the people in Pakistan, India or Bangladesh are outsiders. May be some but most of them changed the religion such as Hindus to Buddhism/Muslim. <br><br>You cannot compare it with Palestine.
Free Palestine
That&#39;s so on point Keerthi ❤thank you for your superb educational videos and i support your opinion too. Great how you explain difficult content.
Its palestinians fault
Free palestine
A lot of wrong information, learn history.
its actually disgusting whats happening both sides are victims in each others story
I dunno my dad told me its because israel and what happened in worl war 2 with the jews and also how the fighitng has been going on for centuries
Israel🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱❤❤❤
Idk why but muslim organisation starts attacks and everything in the name of god it&#39;s ridiculous to see that
When are the muslims ever happy with any desiiiiissionnnsss lmaoaaoo
I support Isreal but I respect Palestine ( HATE PALESTINE %50 |  RESPECT PALASTINE %50 ) •
Okay sure, i see thousands of comments respecting israel. Okay, respect a country that destroyed hospitals in Gaza, and killed 30 THOUSAND people in Gaza, with so much of them being children and babied with the average age of 5 years old. I get that the hamas bombed Israel before, because Palestine wanted a country. But Israel went too far by killing too many people in Gaza. Israel didnt even leave the poor KIDS and literal BABIES alone. Most of the people that were killed arent even part of the hamas which just proves to show that what Israel is doing is bad. People in Gaza barely have any food and have nowhere to live. How about the people in Israel? I get some of them didnt kill the people in Gaza, but theyre laughing about all the dead children.
While this explains a lot, it has some inaccuracies.<br>1. The British won WWII, and they didn’t let go of Palestine until 1947.<br>2. The mission of the UN is to promote peace, so the fighting was likely on accident.<br>Still, great video.
I agree with you<br>Palestine should be given the right to live proudly on its own land but Terrorism is not a solution.
No one is right or wrong in a war and that&#39;s why it&#39;s ugly
Free Palestine🍉
Free palestine ❤
UN is the one who started
From what I understand its not a contry war more like a terrorist attack the terrorist started this tbh <br><br>So i dont support  Palestine nor Isreal  <br>I support the innocent people<br>I dont understand ehy a lot of innocent people are hurt due to some terrorist like let them live in peace <br>I hope someday the good/ innocent people from both the countries can live together happily.<br>I feel so bad for the people from both the countries especially the children like what did they do to deserve this 😭😭  <br><br>Lets all join together and pray for their well being 🙏🙏🙏<br><br><br> <br><br>😢😢
Hell yea mommy
I stand with israel
Yes hammas is a terrorist organization but you have to acknowledge the years of terror and abuse Israel has put palatines thorough during all those occupation. There is too much difference in power between Israel and Palestine. You cannot compare them
Palestine is in the wrong clearly<br>Muslim are worst people they should be erased from this world
Allah unboxing date when??
That&#39;s a long video
Either one is in the absolute right, but no child should be left an orphan because of it.
Ask the brittish. Bharatis really spit on Gandhi-Ji and Pandit Ji huh? For money you seems could betrayed your fellow asian!? And dont you dare saya Hindu vs Islam . indonesian Hindus are nothing like you.
Who is right is palestine
I support Israel
Excellent. Everyone thinks just because you say u support Palestine,  u support terrorism. But its not that black and white
Just shows how much i know my history, i did not know Israel was just formed in 1948
If a country is invaded by foreigners do they have the right to keep that country and displaced the population? Is this legal? Or murder the inhabitants?🤔
You are missing the &quot;occupied Palestinian land by Israel&quot; and a &quot;racist apartheid Israel government&quot;
I honestly don&#39;t care about any lamd issue........ I dont support people being killed!! Free Palestine. I say this being a human
by the way you have read what israel said but you skip totally palestinian view. the truth will show soon or later
israel took palestine land then they offer a partial land to palestine so isreal job done ? !
israel took palestine land then they offer a partial land to palestine so isreal job done ? !
israel can turn on/off water, electricity and internet of gaza ,if this is not occupation what is occupation !
Palestine right
I don’t understand why a piece of land is always so precious than human life’s.
full support for israel.
israel for sure is right.
The terminology used in this video is clearly biased for Israel this is not balanced at all. Zionists came to the land and illegally occupied Palestine and killed and drove people out of their own land and homes this was the start of this war simple as that.
They could have peacefully coexisted but the greed for more ruined it all. I understand the sentiments behind winning the whole country back..but even historically what you loose in a war, sadly you loose. You will still be agitated correct, but the decision of whether you will think about the wellbeing of your people or fight till the last man alive kind of mentality is solely yours to decide. Once you take that decision, and take actions accordingly....it completely becomes your responsibility...the consequences, you must have calculated beforehand and yet took that step willingly. A war..both sides looses but at the end the one who made the call for that 6/7 oct attack has the blood of thousands on his hand and more, and that can&#39;t be denied. Partially people are also responsible, as you can&#39;t expect good governance from a terrorist outfit, especially when you had a better option at hand.
Yeah it’s not like Judea was there first 2000 years ago or anything
Illegally taking land anywhere in the world [USA being the prime example] will lead to war and the Jews have to go back and give the land back to the Palestinians so the blood shed can stop otherwise they will simmer in their own soup
Unbelievable
so in Short Israel has been Invading Palestine since the 1800s and the tension stems from Arabs trying to keep their territory
The demographics and how the land is Abraham is from a land which is Iraq and settled in Palestine which is Israel which means he was brown skinned because tht whole country is a desert hot and dry until the British came and do what they do best colonize and mix created the Jews we know now Thts pale no offense and they leave to Europe mix even more come back even more European in the 1800s if you look at the map and the land everyone around there is browned skinned and either African or Arab or mixed with those two because East African ppl started mixing with them around this time Thts y they look alike anyways my point is Palestine/Israel was an originally black and brown place before the British took over
I love how this immediately starts off with them showing pretty much the recent map without Israel even though Britain was ruling it
Evil called Israel
The end is near
You said &quot;launched an attack&quot; as if they tried to attack the nation of israel and not murder 1,500 innocent civillians
You said &quot;launched an attack&quot; as if they tried to attack the nation of israel and not murder 1,500 innocent civillians
Jews have lived on the land of Israel continuously for almost 4,000 years. The land of Israel is the birthplace of the Jewish people.
This video is severely misleading. No more than 600,000 Palestinians left Israel and more than 68 percent of them left before they even saw any Jewish soldiers. On top of that they were told by the Arab leaders to go ahead and leave for a few days/weeks while they “through the Jews in to the sea”. Palestine’s map also did not look like Israel’s today. The ottomans map was called a sanjak map which outlined the Palestinian land as a small area near the sea. So the land offered to Palestinians by the UN was more than what they had!  On top of that the land patrician given to the Jews was one that had already been purchased by the Jews in the desert/swamp land. The Jews drained the swamp and brought water to the desert and then everybody wanted their land. Stop re writing history.
I hope everyone sees this video
Israel:<br><br>Right: Israelis have a legit claim to the land, it is historically documented outside of the bible that they lived there.<br>Right: It is the center of their religion.<br>Right: They have the right to live in peace, free from missile attacks and terrorism.<br>Wrong: Israel has refused to allow Palestinians to develop Area C as defined by the Oslo Accords in such a way that would create prosperity.<br>Wrong: Israel has greatly limited the Palestinians ability to develop infrastructure and to move freely.<br>Wrong: Israel has abused eminent domain and destroyed Palestinian villages to expand itself.<br><br>Palestine:<br><br>Right: Palestinians have a legit claim to the land. They lived there before WW2.<br>Right: Palestinians have a right to live and prosper.<br>Right: Palestinians have a right to self-determination in the form of developing their own government.<br>Wrong: Palestinian terrorism has been a constant detriment both to the peace process and living conditions.<br>Wrong: When Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza, Palestinians had an opportunity to show the world a Palestinian state would be a good neighbor and peaceful friend to Israel and really put the onus on Israel. Instead, they chose to create a failed terror state that is full of poverty and uses its resources to build rockets and shoot them at Israel.<br>Wrong: Palestine has refused every peace offering made by Israel, including the 2008 Olmert offering giving them East Jerusalem and the Old City.
A Brief History of the name Palestine and its derivative Adjective Palestinian:<br><br> 1.	Palestine is Judea, the Roman name for ‘Land of the Jews’ when the Roman Emperor Hadrian re-named this land as Palestina in 135 CE. Since then, it was never an Islamic State. [‘In the 2nd century CE, the Romans crushed the Jewish revolt and Judea was renamed Syria Palestina’ – Jewish Virtual Libr.]<br><br>2.	The Pre-Islamic Arabs were in the Roman armies and witnessed both Jerusalem’s destruction and the name change of Judea. [Flavius Josephus Wars, Book V, Ch 13, 4]. As well, the Quran mentions Israel as the land of the Jews. Thereby, the Muslim people would be fully aware Palestine referred to the Jews for 2,000 years.<br><br>3.	The historical archives of the Persians, Greeks, Romans, British, French and Americans refer to Palestine as the ‘historical homeland of the Jews’, not of the Muslim peoples. America’s early Presidents initiated Israel’s return prior to Britain and Herzl: “Restoring the Jews to their national home in Palestine is a noble dream. My emancipated hope is the restoring of the Jews to their nation home in Palestine” - President Abraham Lincoln to Canadian Zionist Wentworth Monk; 1863. <br><br>4.	The term Palestine was introduced in the Hebrew Bible from the term Plishtim [‘Invaders’]. The Muslims disdained the name Palestine, as they do the term ‘Zionists’ today. In 1947, the Arabs virtually begged of Britain not to use this name for the land. Thereby, the usurping of this name in the 1960’s is not credible as a mark of land ownership, because it was not one of historical usage by the Arabs. <br><br>5.	 A host of Islamic scholars and historians decried and rejected Muslims as Palestinians.: “Allah Gave the Land of Israel to the Jews. The al-Aqsa Mosque was built on top of Solomon’s Temple.” - Eleventh century historian Muhammad Ibn Ahmad al-Maqdisi and fourteenth century Iranian religious scholar Hamdallah al-Mustawfi // “There is no such thing as ‘Palestine’ in history, absolutely not.” - Arab-American historian and Princeton University Professor, Philip Hitti, testifying before the Anglo-American Committee in 1946] <br><br>6.	A host of Jewish organizations and Institutions were called by the prefix of Palestine or Palestinian in the 20th century, including ‘The Jewish Palestine Brigade’ in Britain’s WW2 Military Forces; The [Jewish] Palestine Symphony Orchestra; Today’s Jerusalem Post media was called “The Palestine Post”. <br><br>7.	 There are no Arab Muslim Palestinians on record prior to the 20th century; the land was referred only as the homeland of the Jews. It is validated by a host of archives by many nations, and some one million Archaeological relics. Thereby, the nativity claim can only apply to Jews. In fact, there was never a time of no Jews in Palestine the past 2,000 years, as evidenced by the Crusaders, Islamic invasions and the previous Ottomans. <br><br>8.	Generally, real natives do not usurp the name of other natives, especially one they disdained. [“There is a propaganda war going on now with regard to the term ‘Palestine.’ It is specifically employed to avoid the use of the name Israel, and must be considered an anti-Israel term.” - Dr. Thomas McCall, the Senior Theologian of Levitt Ministry, quoting Zola Levitt.] <br><br>9.	 The previous Islamic Ottoman rulers of Arabia declared Palestine as the homeland of the Jews. - “Who can challenge the rights of the Jews in Palestine? Good Lord, historically it is really your country” - Ottoman Mayor and scholar Yusuf Diya al-Khalidi; Jerusalem, 1899. <br><br>10.	 Judea’s original, previous name was Israel in 1002 BCE, established under King David; and again in 1947 when this country was re-established by the UN. ‘Israel’ is mentioned in the Quran as one belonging to the Jews. [Joshua J. Mark , Ancient History Encyl.) <br><br>11.	 All Religious Scriptures acknowledge Palestine as the ‘Land of Israel’; ‘Land of Judea’; and ‘Land of the Jews’ – including the Hebrew Bible [1 Samuel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0ftmf_Uv9A&amp;t=799">13:19</a>]; The New Testaments [ ‘And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.’ - Matt. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0ftmf_Uv9A&amp;t=141">2:21</a>]; The Quran - [Surah Al-Ma&#39;idah <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0ftmf_Uv9A&amp;t=320">5:20</a>-21.]; and the Dead Sea Scrolls. <br><br>12.	 The Original Philistines converted to the Hebrew Belief and became Israelites. The term Palestine is derived from the Philistines, a Greek Island people who invaded Canaan some 4,000 years ago. The Philistines converted to the Hebrew belief under a peace offer by King David, and held prominent positions in David’s army. [“They (the Philistines) met with a severe defeat, however, early in the reign of David (2 Samuel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0ftmf_Uv9A&amp;t=320">5:20</a>), he succeeded in reducing them to a state of vassalage (2 Samuel 8:1). In the year of the fall of Samaria (721 B.C.) they became vassals of Sargon. After the time of the Assyrians the Philistines cease to be mentioned by this name. In the ebb and flow of warring nations over this land it is more than probable that they were gradually absorbed and lost their identity. - [The Catholic Encyl.). / The Philistine cities lost their independence to Assyria, and revolts in following years were all crushed. [Myers 1997, p. 313.] / The theory of the “Lost Ten Tribes” calls for (1) all inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom of Hoshea to be deported by Shalmaneser and Sargon, 722-718 B.C [Hearyhim, Weebly, Armstrongism] / They (the Canaanites) were indeed assimilated into the Israelite nation. When the Assyrians overran the Kingdom of Israel, they did not leave any Canaanite aside, as they had all become Israelites by that time. Therefore, the only people that can trace back a lineage to the ancient Canaanites are the Jews. The Canaanites did not exist any longer after the 8th century b.c.e. and they were not annihilated but assimilated into the Jewish people. - [The True Identity of the So-called Palestinians, imninalu] / The Bible describes the Philistines as remaining “subdued” during David’s reign [Philistine; New World Enycl.]/ Josephus, Antiquities, Book 11, Ch.1] &amp; [Esdras <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0ftmf_Uv9A&amp;t=819">13:39</a>] Q. How then did the Muslims become Palestinians, an adjective of Palestine, in the 1960’s, and have been using this name as the antithesis of Judea and Israel¬¬¬? A. The Palestinian Name Deception: Those in the West who manoeuvred this name upon Muslims did so to mock, if not desecrate, the history, belief and culture of the Muslim people. Thereby it should be overturned by honourable Muslims.
Dont take j3ws at any circumstances especially european and Americans it will be your fate but in the last they will go no one accept them in the middle east after what they have done
Gross. Terrorism gets her hair did.
This was very biased and inconsistent
If I were an Israeli citizen watching this I’d feel guilty and just move elsewhere.  But no most of them wanna double down on genocide and you hurt there feelings if aren’t 100% on there side
Ancient Isreal kingdom was established in Canaanites territory after killing the Canaanites and stealing their land, while Israelites originally came from Ur, Babylon/Iraq. Interestingly, neo-Zionism established modern Isreal state while killing the Palestinians and stealing Palestinian land. <br>Palestinians are the descendants of those Canaanites mixed with Minoans and other Levantines and Semitic origins and are the legitimate indigenous inhabitants.
Team 🇺🇸🤝🇵🇸🤝🇮🇱🤝🇲🇨❤️Peace<br>👇
So much lies 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
A very brief and misleading history of the Jewish Palestinian conflict…
maybe its better to ask why all the Muslims countries around didn&#39;t want to gat people from gaza <br>maybe its better to ask where is the country of the Jewish people if not Israel
So many errors in this video.. the State of Palestine never existed! It was an Ottoman territory conquered by the british.
This is a very biased take
Its literally like a cancer
Fax
There is a lot of history missing here.
Its wrong report
So you start telling the story after 1900 and claim you hold the truth? Really? And people that watch this video are &quot;awankened&quot; to the truth?? How about reading about the conflict historically... in the bronze age, iron age this belonged to the jews
We need a comprehensive boots on the ground documentary on the actual illegal settlements in West Bank and what Gaza looks like today
lmao bro why are you guys watching a turkish news channel
So there&#39;s absolutely no history before 1946.
This map has been thoroughly debunked multiple times.  Strange how the Turkish public broadcast service doesn&#39;t seem to care...
Why religion is bad
Why is this &quot;improper for some audiences?&quot;
This is very misleading, first off you start from the near history instead of starting a few thousand years ago.<br>Hamas is not a political group, it is a terror organization terrorizing everyone in the area, Israelis and Palestinians alike.<br>Israel does not attack without a reason, never ever, you state that the Israeli attacks continued but you left out the why, they continued because Palestinians were attacking innocent Israeli civilians, so Israel had to defend itself.<br>At the end you state that Israel should establish peace in the area, well we have tried multiple times in the past 70+ years, with no success because Palestinians never held their side of the peace agreements that they signed on, they just broke the peace agreements whenever they had enough ammunition to kill as many Israelis as possible.<br>So please do check your half facts because you are only showing a one sided story and demonizing Israel, if you bring all of the facts into account than you could call this video history, because for now its just some random facts that happened in history and not the true history of the area.<br><br>You should ask these two simple questions:<br>1. What will happen if israel stops attacking palestinians?<br>2. What will happen if palestinians stops attacking israelis?<br><br>Well, I will help you out, the first answer is that the Palestinians will kill most jews in Israel and take over the land.<br>The second answer is we will have peace here as Israel never strikes first as implied by its army name, Israel DEFENCE forces.<br><br>Good Day
So who startted it
Why did youtube say this is inappropriate? Wtf
Lesson learned, don’t let the British draw borders
You left out many many things,  didn&#39;t you?  Do you think all people are ignorant and unintelligent?  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s frustrating for you and your organization that everyone is not so stupid,  Ave that your propaganda is only effective to ignorant, unintelligent, morons.<br><br>Organizations and people like you do a disservice to the world by attempting to spread this garbage. You and your friends are evil
This is fake news
I suggest that whoever made this looks up the meaning of &quot;objective &amp; truthful reporting&quot;. I guess this is the kind of BS all the western morons who attend &quot;free Palestine&quot; protests get their info from.
You lost me at Zionist movement. Why does such BS keep getting passed on, in new videos, when simple research could disproves nonsense?
Free Palestine 🇵🇭♥️🇵🇸
IT IS NOT A CONFLICT, IT IS AN 0CUUPATION
My solidarity for the long suffering Palestinians population , may God grant them freedom from Israhell
പലസ്തീൻ തീവ്രവാദികൾ 😏
Isreal was created before Christ was born. Even if you dont believe in religion, it was well documented. The Ottoman Empire stole the land during rule and Isreal took it back once the empire fell with the help of Britain. Because isreal and britain both had a sense of democracy. Jerusalem for instance, was never part of Palestine. Like seriously, are people that uneducated? Thats just one lie in many. You need to go waaaaayyy further back to be educated.
As someone who knows history well. This is factually flawed. This is nothing more than a propaganda video and both paties deserve a better detailed explanation. You can&#39;t explain a conflict that has gone on this long in a 5 minute video. Every point you made about the UN and the wars and the PLO and Hamas and the IDF and agreements made in the past need to be explained in detail or else its just gaslighting. Sorry. I feel bad for everyone involved. But this video is just a bunch of bs, and both Isreal and Palestine deserve better. Two thumbs down for this video. Its for the unintelligent.
Long Live Israel 🇮🇱
Clearly, this is a broadcast organization that is Turkish and in opposition to anything Israeli or isn&#39;t Muslim.
Completely laughable you think that this is Real history
Free free Palestine ✌️
Why dont you guys go before this date you always start  at 1946?
This video in my comment shows Hamas crimes
*Isreal declared war on Hamas, NOT Palestinians.  You are part of the problem, not the solution. Israelis are good - Hamas is evil. Wake T.F. up!!
You took the idea of “brief” very seriously and left out many important things😂
This video is so biased<br> Some important questions needs to be asked, <br>why the so called Palestinians didn’t establish a Palestinian country until the jews decided to establish israel? They only remembered they want a country when the jews wanted a country in this region??? What a coincidence right??? <br>Why they defined themselves as Arabs and not Palestinian until the idea of israel came up??? <br>And where is the name “Palestine” / פלשתינה, came from? How is this term ties to the arabs of this region? There were also jews living in this region why only arabs call themselves Palestinian?<br>How can jews be invaders and occupiers if they lived in this land as well? <br>And for this to be an occupation theres need to be a country before, but there was not a country it was only a region under many foreign controls throughout history.<br><br>So basically this video is a bunch of biased nonsense. Stop trying to change history because it fits your narrative.<br>History is factual things that happened not your opinion of what happened
Talk about a totally one sided view.  What a load of nonsense this is.
J
Read the history boos, this is all untrue
what a bunch of lies from the beginning. In 1946 there was NO Palestine. it was called Palestine by the British mandate  - a territory that was controlled by the British empire. In 1947 the UN decided the partition plan - to divide the land to jews and arabs. you must understand that in 1946 during the British rule, all the inhabitants were called Palestinians by the Brits - both Jews and Arabs. <br>Learn some History instead of propagating lies.
From the river to the sea Palestine will be free
Western media are blind about this
This channel spreading wrong info. Before that, that land was under British. Further out, it was under Ottoman rule. And go back further, it was the Kingdom of Israel.
God bless Israel❤❤❤
Don&#39;t know why but after  seeing this even Hitler seems less cruel.
The thumbnail shows that you don&#39;t have a clue about history. The region of Palestine and the state of Palestine are completely different. As a matter of fact, one didn&#39;t officially exist until 40 years after Israel was created, thanks to the refusal of recognizing Israel&#39;s right to exist
Killed: At least 21,822, including more than:<br>8,800 children<br>6,300 women<br>Injured: More than 56,451, including at least:<br>8,663 children<br>6,327 women<br>Missing: More than 7,000<br>The latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the occupied West Bank are as follows:<br><br>Occupied West Bank<br>Killed: At least 319, including more than:<br>83 children<br>Injured: More than 3,800<br>In Israel, officials revised the death toll from 1,405 to 1,139.<br><br>Israel<br>Killed: About 1,139<br>Injured: At least 8,730
@trtworld Is there any way we could translate this video to German so more people can learn the real history of the state?
you know something is wrong when the very first slide shows Jordan as a country in 1946. LMAO
Palestine was never a country to begin with. It&#39;s just a ppl. They claim to be from that area but never was there a complete country formed named Palestine the only country that got formed was Isreal
The first line itself is wrong…the only “Palestine” that existed in 1946 was the British Mandate of Palestine, not a country called Palestine. There was never a country or geopolitical entity called Palestine, just a geographic region controlled by the Mamluks, Ottomans and then the British before 1948.
This is not a  conflict, this is occupation.
Historical Facts of the Palestinian Nation ❤❤
LONG LIVE PALESTINE❤❤🇵🇸🇵🇸
GOD Bless PALESTINE❤❤🇵🇸🇵🇸
Interesting how in 1947 you say zionist gangs violently expelled 750.000 palestinians. You dont mention that the surrounding arab states invaded and went to war against Israel? That is crucial information. So tired of seeing biased narratives hidden as objective narrating
So much misinformation here!
Isn&#39;t this 2000 years late.
the blame goes to no one, but it is true that the land was formerly palestines.
La ghaliba illa Allah😊, it has been mentioned that Palestine will win the war in quran, Inshaallah, the least we can do individually is make dua and pray for them, don’t say I am alone and can’t change anything, do dua for our fellow brothers and sisters❤❤, Islam has overcame this much oppressions, we will overcome this one as well❤❤❤❤❤❤
Stop genoside  free palestion
Well this is a distorted and biased take, now isn’t it?   Or a fan of facts and history are we?
The initial maps don&#39;t make any sense. You appear to be mixing up areas where there are precise settlements, with areas of general political geography. ie  Apples with oranges. I find it difficult to believe the rest of the video if you are attempting to distort facts in the first few video frames.
The Crusaders coming from Europe occupied our land in Palestine for 300 years - in the Middle - and they fought Eastern Christianity and accused them of being heretics and committed brutal killing against them and Muslims, and despite the long period of occupations, the insistence of our ancestors on regaining their land remained... and this is what is happening now - Palestine. For its people and it will only be for its people, and whoever wants to live with us in peace, we have no problem provided that he abandons his colonial ideas....
Why not show a map before 1946? Like when Jews inhabited the land before anyone else?
you make a lot of good points but you fail to tell the truth
&quot;We never took land from the Palestinians.&quot; -People currently taking land from the Palestinians.
This video is pretty bias
You forgot to mention Palestine was the name the Roman Empire gave to the land.. Palestinians were everyone who lived there, including Jews.. So saying the Jews kicked Palestinians out is a complete distortion of history. Moreover, the history began far before the Roman Empire existed (meaning before the invention of the word Palestine), and archaeological evidence say that there was a majority of Jews living on the land that was referred as The Land of Israel.<br><br>In essence, this video is a twisted interpretation of history, and I suggest those who claim otherwise to look for evidence from reputable unbiased sources online.
False 😂😂😂
So are you saying Israel displaced all those people in a day? Because the 5 Arab nations invaded and attacked Israel the very next day after they rejected the 2 state solution. And why start at the Ottoman Empire? Why not explain why the Jews were in Europe to begin with and where they originated from.
Why this channel doesn&#39;t explain that Israel bombing Gaza after those terrorists attacked and launched thousands of rockets to Israel.
Youtube required me to sign in, saying this video was not appropriate for some ages. Seems like they are trying to pevent this video from reaching and educating more people.
maybe stop constantly waging war and actually accept peace deals aye?
Lern some history
This information only focus on how many people Israel had kill but what about the Palestinian ?
BREAKING: Gaza Protests ERUPT Against Hamas?<br><br>More like you at Tel Aviv buddy. Protest going on everyday 🤣🤣🤣

who heads the UN? did it demand hamas to release the hostages? all it does is lobby for a ceasefire from countries. UN youre getting so OBVIOUS!
The citizens of Gaza were celebrating in the streets on October 7th.
ha ha ha....very good entertainment from this channel...i like it
All the boses of Hamas stay in 7 stars hotels and every single one is richer then Thrump! And the population and morons are dieyng for a lie
lol...such fake news is being fed into Israelis. pls watch some other neutral channel to get to truth.
Our prayers for all of you! Turn to Jesus Christ, he will  protect, guide, and help bring back all the hostages. Peace for Israel and will continue to keep you in our prayers! Jesus Christ is coming soon!
U lying lol the whole world knows and laughs at u people

“They don’t want to escalate hostilities to start a war” are you kidding me how was oct 7 not a act of war. They are doomed as long as the US sides with israel
Donald trump  ban money  for iran. Thanks  John biden  make all  money for iran  export  oil
Please show evidence that Norway has been financing the underground tunnels!!!
I am more into the Ukraine war it appears on the surface to be more combatant based. What is going on here is just a big mess , hard to be entertained by any of it because everyone makes every belligerent action so stupid political. Is like everyone is more interested in making video than having a nice destructive war.
Israel as sekutu teroris
God bless and protect the IDF
We stand with Israel unconditionally
Thank you again for reporting on a regular basis..please stay safe..we are praying for the Chayalim and hostages safe return home..
Israeli troops killed thousand and thoussnd of palestinian muslims, so why they release jews hostages? Is there any UN resolution that can stop caward israel for killing innocent women and children...
Zionism is what&#39;s left after you drain Judaism of its moral principles, ethics, and spirituality and replace them with the exact opposite of all the Ten Commandments.

The only country in the world that is still colonized is Palestine... don&#39;t lie to history...?
What about the protests for Bibi&#39;s resignation?
Israel will not enter Rafah before ramadan, government are full of traitors and cowards!
Of course, as a jew, you&#39;re not credible.
Thank goodness that people are realizing that Israel is guilty of crimes against humanity. Support for Israel is tanking worldwide and its long overdue! Israel is engaging in ethnic cleansing and genocide. Unfortunately this is what Israel has always done. Zionists didn&#39;t colonize Palestine with the intention of becoming part of the community that already existed there. They came to displace and exclude the people of Palestine from their homes and land physically and politically. Zionists require a &quot; final solution&quot; for Palestinians. Its really no surprise that this hasn&#39;t worked out well for anyone, is it?<br>Continuing the apartheid, Continuing the genocide of the people of Palestine will not result in a sustainable future for Israel.
🙏🙏🙏Praying for all the people of Israel
Finally free Palestinians from Hamas
Did it occur to Israel that Biden probably hides antisemitism agenda which explains why he&#39;s giving Iran time and money to develop nukes ? Consider these concrete facts: Americans destroyed Iraq totally even infant milk factories based on suspicion of developing WMD, while iran brags about crossing the peaceful 20% enrichment to 60% and there&#39;s no action from  US..Iran is being lavishly financed through the Iraqi government (which is a stooge if iran), under the full blessing of Biden administration... probably,  Biden wants Iran to destroy Israel...Israel should raise this flag to American and EU before it&#39;s too late.
Propagating fake news. You have to stop genocide
Propaganda
Thank you
Everything is lies iran is best friend of Israel because shia always cheating muslims
Israel, people or Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, you are the people of the promess made by God to Abraham. Keep fighting, your God is with you!<br>Remember; never give an inch!!!
How the F do you all sleep at night, killed more than 30,000 people and you think you are fighting a war
Jeeez…what war are they fighting, where is the other army besides the occupation force…this is a genocide, starving population, blocking their escape
Israel ❤
Israel says it has been  &quot;aggressively patroling Rafah &quot;  but infact it  has been indescriminately bombing civilians homes  in Rafah  deceasing many civilians sheltering there after  they had moved from other areas  to this supposed safe area .
The IDF themselves in thier field operations used many former schools  ,  Unwra and UN buildings for thier troop  positions and firing points
Claims about UNWRA and hamas developing from within UNWRA its self  are fake news propaganda :-<br><br>There is no independent evidence that  these claims are true or even partially true ,  merely hear say propagated by the Israel regime and the IDF .
Claims about Hamas  using  schools  , the UN  building and UNWRA buildings whilst in use for thier intended purposes are incorrect  and fake news .   They are only using the now long empty buildings previously  used by these organsiations  but long since abandoned as IDF bombing and shelling in the area rendered them  unsafe for staff and the organisations evacuated from them completely .
The only thing making the palestinian people suffer is the evil arrogance of the Israel leadership
The USA and its mini me  Israel are the axis of evil in the middle east .
Israel is a terrorist state and the IDF  is its terrorist militia
Israel have managed  to decease  12000  innocent  children and 8000 mothers in gaza .   however this has resulted in Israel being on trial for genocide at the ICJ
IDF lost the war
Fakenews
Idf has only managed to free 3 hostages alive   with a loss of 570  troops in the process .
Pinto  fails to tell us that there are equally strong demonstrations by  Israel citizens against Netanyahu  and his goverenment in Israel cities.
Its about time Netanyahu &amp; his gang take heed of the one authourity they claim to respect! The &#39;Tanakh&#39; at Jeremiah 22:3 &quot;Thus saith the LORD: &quot;Do what is just &amp; right.rescue from the defrauder him who is robbed;Do not wrong the stranger (Alien), the fatherless boy &amp; the widow.Commit no lawless act, AND DO NOT SHED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT in this place.&quot; ( The Jewish publication bible 1988)
Regarding the leaders, they are siphoning off millions if not billions from the funding to continue hostilities. Why would they stop? It is all a racket for them. Notice the international community and finance fraud investigators don&#39;t seem to care where their wealth comes from? Yet in the USA, they will accuse and attack Trump for &quot;over valuing&quot; properties that the banks, investors, and other real estate developers all agreed and signed off on. The game is rigged.
🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🙏🏼🙏🏼🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
HAMAS IS CURSED.
ITF that has murdered 25000 innocent civilians in gaza is biggest terrorist organization. Criticism of policies of israel is never anti semitism. Palestinian arabs are semites too.
The Palestinians need to turn against Hamas!
Free free pelastine
Thanks for revealing the truth Yair, this is a complex war, &amp; hearing that the authorities who are supposed to help protect the innocent, are helping the terrorists, is so bad &amp; they need to be held to account. Stay safe.
Stop the Genocide. Free palestine!!!!
That is a false teaching what the Hisbollah  and other religeous leaders teaches,  that if they kills enemies they will go to heaven.  In the Bible,  in Ecclesiastes 9:5-6 , it says:<br>&quot;&quot;For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all, nor do they have any more reward, because all memory of them is forgotten.  6 Also, their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, and they no longer have any share in what is done under the sun&quot;&#39;&#39;.<br>The dead they could not do anything anymore. They did not go to heaven. They are sleeping now in the graves (John 5:28) and to be resurected in the future.<br>Better to study the bible  so that the people will learn to love one another. (John 13:34-35) 🥰😍❤<br>If all people on earth are like the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses who study the bible and apply in their lives what the bible says, the whole World will be peaceful all in all.❤❤
Why don&#39;t you people stop all type of help including humanitarian to gaza. And whole world should stop funding UN and all Muslim countries
Prayers prayers 🙏 ❤
Free Palestine
Under the UN a lot of bad things have been done to people in many places in the world. I am sure by now most people in international security know. As such, the people in Gaza can only get relief aid from that UN agency for Gaza.
The UN is disgusting!!!!!  They are the real war criminals!!!!
Is your Israeli people who protesting

FASCIOSIONISTs are indifferent if you belong to HAMAS OR OPPOSER OF HAMAS <br><br>YOU MUST FLEE<br><br>LET S SEE WITNESS WHAT IS THE HORRIBLE BEHAVIOUR IN WEST BANK
Never trust Muslims especially around children. The Prophet Muhammad married a 9yr. old girl when he was 53 yrs. old😮it’s in their so called holy book📖
Why are the leaders allowed to live in luxury?
I pray for peace in Jerusalem

Israel EXIT gazza
What kind of country can have a pay for slay policy and isn&#39;t considered a terrorist? Only Palestinians. Nice, when you sleep with pigs you might wake up with a chunk of meat off your back.
For decades the Palestinians had the Pay for Slay, no one batted an eyelid. Now Israel is defending itself and everybody&#39;s crying. You reap what you sow.
It&#39;s nice to see that there are people fromn every part of the world reading The Economist. For me personally it&#39;s the best way to get important news. Especially all the various podcasts and quick reading when in subway. I highly reccomend getting he podcst+ deal until you can.
Have you ever asked yourself if the Palastinians even want a two state solution? The first rule of negotiation is to underatand what each side desires
Israelis (Jewish people) lived in Gaza since the 10th century BCE, around the time of King David. The Palestinians have no legitimate claims to Gaza. This  has been an abracadabra paradigm since around 2005.   At that point, Israelis were  &quot;expelled&quot; from the area after terrorists (proxies of Iran) went about murdering Israelis but still demanded free,  fresh water, free electricity, and  free plumbing, paid for by Israel  because Hamas did not believe in Palestinian infrastructure building.
NO! Not till Israel gets out of PALESTINE!..Thats Obvious to Everyone!
Hamas cannot be defeated by war and bombing of innocent Palestinians. Israel is only created a bigger &amp; stronger Hamas.
Isn&#39;t a bit irony..most peaceful community demanding peace with most peaceful methods 😂😂
NO.
Saudi Arabia brings Americans to Middle East that’s is the end of peace  in Middle East
The path to peace is actually not easy. You see the tunnels built shows insurrection. It is an idea copied from the vietnamese during the vietnam war which the people of vietnam won against the americans. It shows that they spent vast amounts of money trying to reclaim Gaza covertly. However no one knows how they could have done that without everyone in Gaza having some knowledge of it. Did Israel know? Did they help build those tunnels? I actually think the tunnels are a symbol of defiance but the problem is now that they have been discovered, they will have to be destroyed because the question remains who supplied millions of dollars to build these vast networks. I am totally against going after poor people who are defenceless regardless of how &quot;ungrateful&quot; they are but politics/ agendas/dogmas/extremeviews is usually evil like that. What is happening in Gaza is an example of what happens to poor people everyday around the world. The attack may not be as obvious but they are just as much made a mockery of by the souless. If I say now the Jews have contributed alot to the world I would be shut down by pro palestinian supporters who will ask me how is genocide a positive contribution to the world. I would then have to delete my comment in fear of retaliation when all I was doing is trying to tell people this is why they enjoy alot of support in the world today. My maternal grandfather survived WW2 and he once told me it is better being mistaken for a Muslim than a Jew and I think that is precisely why Europe drove them out but not muslims. So today when we look at Gaza, we must look back at WW2 and ask ourselves why they needed to drive them out of europe through genocide. I think what happened to the Jews during WW2 should never be repeated again because it was sick and wrong to do that to anyone yet today we hear of common people all over the world still being used as guinea pigs without their consent for various experiments social or otherwise.
How can you talk about peace when your goal is to ‘mow the lawn’ ready for another land grab! This evil has been repeating itself for decades!
No..Hamas have destroyed the Palestinian people. Gaza will be occupied by Israel for long term  security of Israel .The Economist written from Western White man perspective.
The land is so big, why cant both stay together in peace.
It is antisemitic and pro-Putin to call for a ceasefire to stop the genocide.<br><br>Israel appreciates the billions of Dollars in foreign aid and military assistance, but it is too little, if Thomas Stauffer&#39;s estimate is not doubled every year, America must send troops to defend Israel and be bogged down in another forever war or else risk prioritizing its own national interests first at the expense of its shared interests with the &quot;only democracy&quot; in the Middle East. <br><br>Think of the Ben-Gvirs and other peace-loving people ready to settle Gaza immediately after your sacrifices--they are ready to live in the rubble just to spite their enemies!
he he Queen &amp; king curse with cancers😅cow gates
Israel not choosen people anymore.. no more 6days war won😅
Palestine predates Jews. When the Prophet Abraham (Peace be Upon Him) got to that land there were already people there called Palestinians.
# Amlonoesnarco
No. Not until the war is won.
Did the rule based order touting Economist put something out on Genocide and war crimes being committed by Israel or they plan to continue to pretend that is not happening?
Question should be will the west stop arming and funding an apartheid state that commits Genocide and ethnic cleansing.
They have no money no power and yet the whole world&#39;s support is with them, yet they have the support of the free humans of the whole world Allahu Akbar ❤ God&#39;s Chosen people ❤
Bla blah all these talking head &quot;experts&quot; opinions are no more valid than anyone elses. They are just useless parasites at best
Evolution and natural selection will do the work we will just have to watch
In alleys and streets, the voices rise,<br>Echoes of resistance, touching the skies,<br>From every corner, young and old,<br>Palestine’s story, bravely told.<br> <br>Stone against might, hand in hand,<br>On this sacred, cherished land,<br>From dawn to dusk, they remain firm,<br>With every chant, their spirits affirm.<br><br> In the heart of conflict, love remains,<br>Through the struggles, through the pains,<br>For in each echo, hope persists,<br>In the land where resistance exists.
Yes of course, il faut juste arrêter de se battre.
This war has to stop wirhout any condition. Israel is doing what russia is doing in ukraine.
U.S🤝Palestine 👑 <br>U.S🤝ISREAL 💩💩
🇦🇲🇮🇱🇦🇲🇮🇱🇦🇲🇮🇱🇦🇲🇮🇱❤️💙❤️💙❤️💙❤️💙
It was never about the hostages, it was always about land grab.
Палестинцам желаю терпения и сил. Ваша слава обязательно вновь восторжествует
Don’t poke a bear with a stick, or better yet don’t poke a bear without a back up…
Biden and the millions and millions of Americans support lsreal.<br>The IDF deserves praise and respect from the World!!!!
I think people fail to realise that this will never end as the zionists want to takeover much more significant parts of the Middle East which is their “Promised Land” by pushing Palestinians out and occupying gaza with illegal settlements this is only part of their big plan which doesn’t seem to be going to well as the Palestinians are fighting for their land without any of the technology or billions of so called aid money funded by the US to Israel!
Saudi Arabia was the country that presented the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002. What the statement indicated does not deviate from any attempt since then to give peace a chance.
Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stated its affirmation that there must be a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital as a solution to the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict.
Where is World War 3? When is the solar storm?<br>The economist 🤔
It&#39;s not a conflict; Israel is occupying Palestinian.
Is Israel going to rebuild what they destroyed?
All are one and pre-planned. Netanyahu and changing the law and canceling prosecution and immunity! How Hamas defeats a small group of an army! Why the Israeli army did not pay attention to Egypt&#39;s warning! Maybe the soldiers will be surprised, but what about cameras and smart devices!!! Seal and humanity are victorious, stop the mafia gangs. I hate petrification, whoever it is. Do the ancestors of criminals have peaceful and happy souls? Never, never, never
Freee palestine 🇵🇸 and demokratic congo🇨🇩
It’s never been about the hostages.  It’s never been about the attack.  It’s always been about the territory.<br><br>If Netanyahu’s Zionist government hadn’t supported Hamas for so long in order to siphon power from the PLO and derail efforts towards the creation of a Palestinian state getting rid of them would be a lot easier.<br><br>Bibi and his party propped up the very group they’re using as an excuse to obliterate and displace the Palestinians. <br><br>They allowed the attack on Oct 7 to take place despite knowing about it in advance exactly for this reason.  They wanted an excuse for the siege which is an extension of their oppressive treatment of the Palestinians for decades prior the Oct 7 attack by Hamas.<br><br>The Israeli slaughter of over 26,000 Palestinians - the vast majority of which have been women and children are just the means to an end.<br><br>And sadly the U.S. is complicit due to its support of Israel in part because of the influence of groups like AIPAC.<br><br>No country should have the kind of power Israel does over the United States.  <br><br>And yet there’s Israel, telling the United States of America, “We will do whatever we want to do” while holding their hand out for more $BILLIONS in US taxpayer money.
Benjamin Netanyahu is 74 years old he has been told he will be the last Prime Minister of Israel when the Jewish Messiah comes. In addition, unblemished Red Heifers have been delivered to Israel, which is very rare. Its ashes need to be placed to build the 3rd Temple in Jerusalem. <br>To sum up, Benjamin Netanyahu sees himself as the Messiah&#39;s helper and he is fulfilling divine prophecy.
Four stages of repentance.  Stage 1, you realize that you done wrong.  Stage 2 there are feelings of guilt about your sins. Stage 3 you renounce your sin or turn away from it. Stage 4, you&#39;re restored that when repentance takes place
Beast peace cometh and then the end
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv_-B6uwpuU&amp;t=12">0:12</a> &quot;…including Israel&#39;s recognition of a Palestinian state&quot; – What does this even mean? To recognize something, it first has to exist.
no palestine
Not quiet enough not to infuriate Iran
I dont see how. Small chance if the Iranian regime falls.Theheran always supportd the most violent Palestinian facyion. But even then.<br>And if thete is peace. Thete is only rubble. And thousands of deaths on both sides. <br>Tell me how. I want to know.<br>I know 2 ways but those are to horrible to consider.
After this war (which I hope will end quickly) a few things must happen:<br><br>Hamas can no longer rule Gaza, their reckless &quot;operations&quot; put their people at risk time and time again.<br><br>The current israeli goverment must resign. It never tried to search for a long-term solution to this conflict and failed to protect their people as well.<br><br>The Palestinian authority must recognize Israel as a country and (sorry for the reguritated term) condemn Hamas and its actions. If they want to govern Gaza they need to prevent agression on their behalf<br><br>Those three things will lead to a fertile land for a long term solution.
It&#39;s possible,  but Pali needs to agree to it
I mean, who knows, and for how long. If you want peace, work for justice. And control your lions if you can&#39;t support your progeny.
Oh dear, you&#39;ve made a video about Jews and Muslims... Just a few things to remember:  everything you&#39;ve said is wrong, racist, [enter word]-phobic, too sympathetic, not sympathetic enough, far too aggressive but could also do with being more aggressive..<br><br>Now, to watch the video.....
APPLY THE LAW!<br><br>United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 (S/RES/242) was adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council on November 22, 1967, in the aftermath of the Six-Day War. It was adopted under Chapter VI of the UN Charter. The resolution was sponsored by British ambassador Lord Caradon and was one of five drafts under consideration.<br>The preamble refers to the &quot;inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in which every State in the area can live in security&quot;.<br>Operative Paragraph One &quot;Affirms that the fulfillment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles:<br>(i) Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;<br>(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.&quot;<br>Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon entered into consultations with the UN Special representative over the implementation of 242. After denouncing it in 1967, Syria &quot;conditionally&quot; accepted the resolution in March 1972. Syria formally accepted UN Security Council Resolution 338, the cease-fire at the end of the Yom Kippur War (in 1973), which embraced Resolution 242.<br>On 1 May 1968, the Israeli ambassador to the UN expressed Israel&#39;s position to the Security Council: &quot;My government has indicated its acceptance of the Security Council resolution for the promotion of agreement on the establishment of a just and lasting peace. I am also authorized to reaffirm that we are willing to seek agreement with each Arab State on all matters included in that resolution.&quot; <br><br>United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 (S/RES/242) was adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council on November 22, 1967.<br>The official response from Israel came on 1 May 1968, by the Israeli ambassador to the UN, when he expressed Israel&#39;s position to the Security Council: &quot;My government has indicated its acceptance of the Security Council resolution for the promotion of agreement on the establishment of a just and lasting peace.

Can I have my time back?
Peace is only possible by eating spiritual food. If you starve yourself of spiritual food then you will die a spiritual death. And the food everyone needs is Jesus and His Truth.
Long live Israel and Long live the Jewish people!
its the Hamas, NOT the Palestinians
No. Palestinians live in multigenerational state of victim hood and groom their children for killing since the moment their born. They will never accept peace no matter how generous or favourable. It’s always temporary for them, only for as long as it necessary to regroup, recruit and buy new stocks of ammunition.
No. Because It&#39;s Impossible.

How did India start worshipping cows?!?!?<br><br>I think thats a more important question.
Responding through the rape,killing and starvation of many times more Palestinians?😡
👍
Little knowledge that was gained in toilet...
How did Isreal with such great military power did not know about hamas’s attack beforehand also why was the IDF delayed at that time? Makes me wonder if they did it purposely so as a reason for gen0cide
Muslims will naver accept that hamas is rapist

half knowledge is dangerous
If anyone Is an Israel Supporter here and thinks 7 October was the starting of the conflict and Hamas did that for Nothing. Please search:<br>OMAR PALESTINE ATTACK IN RAMADAN ANS CHECK TGE UPLOAD DATE.
Fuonbhu
All these pro Palestine comments do they not have brains are they just following trends.
Wrong information
Why are hindus discussing Abrahamic history? You people dont even belong there. <br>Kindly stick to your beliefs and maybe gain some knowledge lol
What did Israel think was gonna happen after decades of killing Palestinians ?
Ah! Here comes half seasoned chicken! Before opening his mouth he could have researched about it. But no!  He could have directly asked some Israeli soldier  to marry him . <br>Y is he trying to impress them with lies?
I actually don’t know who to support now
Bro is the movie from the middle😅
No, do y’all really think Israel won’t fight back after the bombings of Hamas? Imagine you got shot 10 times and you shoot back then everyone blames you. I support justice for the people living in Palestine and Israel. Let them live freely under the Israel flag 🇮🇱 both Muslims and Jewish civilians ✡️☪️
Then what does israel expected after taking their home
Its actually start since 1948 and before hamas was exist
Wow i love it when u start a video from the middle u get sooo many wrong ideas and get surprised at the end by the trutj
Free palestain
Hahahaha Bhai Thora par la yrr
Did he think world came into existence on October 7 😂😂😂<br>Bring an Educated person
How can someone interview a person who is so much illiterate? <br>😂😂😂😂
This guy thinks universe started on October 7 😂😂😂😂😂<br>This is the reality of hindus in India
I find it funny. Someone educated like him is this stupid! Who the hell starts this conflict from October 7th? Only ignorant
Whatsapp University ka founder he bacha tha wo bhi bula lia bhai ne
You had to go 1930 to see israel had captured palestine.
This guy has no clue what he’s talking about. 😂 <br><br>No evidence has been presented by the Israelis regarding their grape and torture allegations. Contrast the propaganda from this charlatan with the testimonies of the realised Hamas hostages who state that they were treated humanely by their captors. 🤦🏼
This guy is just spewing the same old propaganda retric word by word. Come on guy, come up with an original thought. &quot;They thought Hamas was behaving itself.&quot; Meanwhil, treating the palastinians as animals, taking over their homes. Arresting and killing children for no reason.
You are bloody bastards who support isreal , that you watched this movie from this season Isreal kept on attacking and kept on genocide from 1948
Free Palestine🇵🇸❤️😔
Ah yes, the classic october 7th card pulled out as always.
Indians 😂
Also, it acctually started more than 50 years ago, Israel was torturing and killing the Palestinians because they think it’s “their land”
For them History itself starts from October 7 😂 like there was nothing before that...
Bro started at the saison 7 😂 what a stupid analysis with the accent 🤣
🇮🇱👎👎👎
Shame on you people. You call yourself educated wearing masks of a saintly person whose brain when viewed from the inside is actually void <br>Do you know that what Statements you give are only half true because it all started when these white isra**ians came in begging for shelter <br>I know you have researched but still refuse to accept the truth because you don&#39;t have the courage to speak for humanity<br>I don&#39;t think you have even seen how these poor Pales**nian people have been martyred <br>My blood boils seeing so much hatred that you have your eyes blinded by the false media <br>&quot; Indeed, it is not the eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts in the chests that grow blind&quot; <br> <br>If a thief comes to your home for shelter and after living at your house tells you to leave your own house which you build from your own blood sweat and tears will you give it to him and tell him to take and live in the streets? Similarly the Jewish came to Pale**ine and started to throw them out of their own Motherland <br> I mean i know how hypocrite you people are as we all can see what is currently happening in this country but still dont be so &quot; beghairat &quot; Atleast have the shame
Hamas raping?😂 Ging us proof?
isreal and amirika has killed too many innocent palestinian children and babies and fathers and mothers grandpas and grandmas and animals and much more isreal you are not a winner in this world everyone knows that isreal kills innocent palestinians if you kill babies and children Israel must stop killing innocent Palestinians<br>It&#39;s not about Hamas, it&#39;s about the country and they want Muslims dead and they want to take away their land, this has been going on for 75 years, so you know, it is not about Hamas, they use that as a reason, Israel is attacking the Palestinians, so it is not self-defense, Israel must be stopped<br>Free palestine🇸🇩🇸🇩🇸🇩🇸🇩
An ignorant is speaking 🔊!!!! Hahaha
That one guy in comment section trying to free Palestine 🤡
Beerbiceps asking the one who was born after 7th October
Shut up Palestine gave land to Israel and Israel stole more land like if you support Palestine 🇵🇸 ❤
Damn Hamas started it and know Gaza is suffering for it
If you dare then tell the whole story. 😠🫡
Please stop spreading half new! there is also the remaining part of the story ,go study what Israel did in Palestine for 75 years.😢😥😭😥😥

Youre history ONLY STARTS AFTER 7TH OCTOBER ? This is called lying
Ye tou aaqual say ganja hay really
Bro which serial r u watching ? <br>Free free palestine ❤
Have u forgetton history i guess
Israel knew about it from Egypt in August. They had the intelligence and let the attack happen so they have a reason to bulldoze the gaza strip. Netanyahu sent money to hamas under the table after the blockade in 2005. He really made the country even worst for israelis
I know what happen between of them it&#39;s one of your place need True God like Jesus the true God
it’s crazy how confidently he can spew misinformation.
This channel is useless. You can see homes getting demolished, people are running for food, leaked image of israeli soldiers abused.
Palastine ❤
Free Palestinian people<br>Free Palestine 🇵🇸<br>Free Israel 🇮🇱 from the map 🗺️
Free Palestinian people<br>Free Palestine 🇵🇸<br>Free Israel 🇮🇱 from the map 🗺️

Wow.. I&#39;m impressed with the stupidity... Did he know that most of the oct 7th victims are killed by the IOF attack helicopters and tanks?? And the whole thing is not started on oct 7th..
Bro don’t even what the reality is 😂
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 ❤
Shame on youuuuuuuuuuu
I see why india friend Israel. So manipulate.
Shame on u ...go and read history and then come with your knowledge.
NIA should actually keep a check on the comment section. Potential terrorists in the comment section.
Bruh get off this channel and go educate yourself
👎
Israel got new comrade a bald one
Rat
For people who say free Palestine please educate ur self😁😊
Wrong!!!! Decades ago after the 2nd war... Colonial Britain washed its hands of Palestine, deals were done with the UN and the jews. The jews moved in and systematically started stealing land by force and killing the Palestinian people. Self written laws granting them legal theft in thier own eyes. Similar laws like the ICJ ruled on against them, that they now dont recognise. October 7th was a retaliation for decades of occupation and cruelty. It was not an attack...I was a defensive action. Put the timeline in its context and see who did wrong to who first. Thus it is not aggression but defence Hammas initiated.
Sir Palestinians are Muslim wo kabhi Galat galti se bhi nhi soch sakte kisiko aap show bulalete hai thik nhi hai sir
It started way before 1948 it started in Bible times when jews settled the land in place of the evil Canaanites and before you say I got my education from a toilet there is proof that cannanites engaged in child sacrifice and ritual prostitution and Muslims didn&#39;t settle the land until the 600s when the Islamic empire took over the place so it&#39;s safe to say that jews settled the place first, therefore, they should get the land plus Sinai however this does not justify Israels horrific crimes against Muslims
Paided sh*t

I think this person follows what usa media says ,i think he must read some Indian history books on Israel Palestine issue,what he said is showing he is having less knowledge or he is a hypocrite
When no knowledge people talk about knowledge 😂😂😂😂 <br>Dumb ass 😂😂
&quot;In respons Israel has killed HUNDERDS of people in Gaza ...... ?? YOU WHAT?<br><br>All ready for years Israel is making life of Palestinians impossible in order to wipe them out slowly. The action of Hamas made an end to this. <br>According to the Jews Israel is the promised land by God. That makes the Jews the promised people. And that&#39;s what in the mind of the Jews and in their Thora.<br>How can a people like the Jews &quot;treat&quot; the Palestinians in a way that reminds of the Holocaust? You might think the Holocaust didn&#39;t happen in the way history books tell us. Is there a psychological declaration for such?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4CnoqvI_bQ">https://youtu.be/c4CnoqvI_bQ?si=bRNVlquCoq4AFlu_</a><br>remember?
Then history started with &quot;established jewish state&quot;....before that,there is nothing,,even the time won&#39;t yet started
I don’t know why the neighbouring arabs declined/refused the 2 states offer. That sounded like a very good idea since neither group really own the land to begin with ( pre bible era) none of them even lived there. <br><br>Creating 2 states mean they both have their own countries. A win win? By refusing the proposal was it really worth it? The million of lives lost through a disagreement over some stupid lands.
The music has ended but God&#39;s love never does. I put my faith in God to, through the star of Bethlehem, add another chair and the children of Abraham will live in peace side by side. In Jesus name<br>Amen
Wrong. Israel responded by killing people from hamas not Palestinians in gaza
They want the colonial war terrosits to leave  them and their land alone and return to europe and other countries they came from. Its juat as simple as that
Crazy how “killing hundreds in Gaza” turned into killing 30,000
Dont feel symphaty for the people who can not live together in peace. you are wasting your time and energy.
الاسرائيلين سرقوا وطن الفلسطينين
To those people who supports palastine only and particularly to those Muslims who says palastine is right in the name of allaah.. just answer this damn question wht was hamas thinking of how Israelis respond.. if u r not powerful enough to protect ur country then don&#39;t go attacking other powerful entities.. and also if u go back in time you&#39;ll find that many countries conquering it and capturing it.. well British was ruling so they took their decision there&#39;s nothing israel or palastine could do.. hamas is a terrorist organisation who even kill their civilians itself do some research about their brutality on their civilians itself.. so to those many ppl still defending.. wht if we Indians start attacking Pakistan saying that its our land .. and was just only given by British.. talking about past which was not in ur control is foolishness... And another question wbt the jews who had to flee everywhere they go.. before supporting palastine do some research...
🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
It doesn’t matter who you support in the war, but I think everyone can agree that the innocent civilians and children being killed on both sides is completely unacceptable. I hope that this conflict can come to an end in the most peaceful matter possible.
I refuse to allow differing opinions about Biden and Trump or this Israeli/Palestinian war ruin my relationships with my adult children.
How do we know whose telling the truth
i believe that we as a human being have such a smart and clever mind so that we cant convince with a wrong informatios though every one around as trust on the false one... therefore please search of the real story of Palastine and be honest because you are responsible about your ideas.... this is not just for this channel. this is for every one of you guys
You don’t know anything so don’t just assume you can’t tell us what hamas wants your just giving your own opinion they want their hostages back and have been trading coaches full of Muslim hostages which you don’t know about for just a few israleis who were let well and fed and looked after
Something is wrong about this video Israel rejected and still rejects to have two countries
This is the cost of religion. Primitive thinking.
Isn&#39;t Israel the promised land? So its theris
No Israel has responded by killing tens of thousands of people in Gaza
It is Islam everytime there&#39;s no need to explaine anything..

I&#39;m sorry but this short few min explanation  is not satisfactory. The land belonged to Palestinians and was taken over by the majority Jewish people. The land should not have been given to the Jews by uk as it was never there&#39;s. Fa&#39;s food Palestinians  have been kicked out the the racist zionist state and Palestinians  Just want to return and have their land back. The Palestinians  are being oppressed  by Israelis
That is Israel&#39;s land since the Bible days. All that happened inbetween cannot undo that.
I love how you dodged mentioning that Israel invaded Palestine in 1948 under the green lights of the civilized west <br><br>Well, Palestine has always existed. Whether you accept it or not! The olive trees are witnesses on the long history of Palestine and the Palestinian culture.
Sounds like Germany (and maybe Britain) needs to clean up the mess they made
im sorry i think u got a point wrong israel killed more than 10000 people in gaza not just a 100 and there are more under the rubble. we have a side who treats hostages like human beings and the other side that is bombing civilians that include women and children
I dont get why jewish is doing this when they lived threw it?
You need to check the British census figures for the 1940&#39;s The number of Jews, Arabs and others.
One day they&#39;re dressed in &#39;civilian clothes,&#39; and the next day we know what they are wearing
This report is historically wrong<br>The Palestinians had their own state as palestine way before the resolution in 1947<br>Its even stated in Balfour’s declaration “to establish a homeland for the jewish people in PALESTINE” in 1917<br>Palestine was a state in which muslims and christians and even jews lived in harmony before the idea of zionism that wanted this land since 1890 , 50 years before the holocaust
Israel seems to be really good at getting people to support Hamas...<br>After seeing Israel&#39;s war crimes, the crimes of Hamas look like tiny papercuts in comparison.
One if Ten Commandments <br>Thou shall not kill! <br><br>These religion folks killing each other lol err  they both already lost and dont even know at this point they’re just playing around with their artillery like toys…

Israel army = gay soldiers
well as long as they are good muslims they will  surely win   jews  will never win a war against any1 they will b sufferin&#39; till the judgement day coz they ki.ll.ed prophets  and blv they are superior than  other humans even  than   God himself thats why God said that they will never have a &quot; home&quot;  read Coran &amp; u&#39;ll understand all whats happening in our era
Pride is the devil
122 days and Israel is listening only to Israel and stopping for nobody thats the reality.
A few questions:<br>Who agreed the Jews establish a state on the border of Palestine?<br>Who sailed the Jews to this land?<br>Has they ever asked the people living on this land if they agree or not?<br>So unfair!<br>Asking Pakistan not to retaliate and maintain so-called kindness?<br>Without experiencing hardships oneself, one should not advise others to do good.
Hamas killed thousands not hundreds
It goes back way further than the 1940s go do some research and stop manipulating people to fit your narrative.
You mean Israel has responded by killing TENS of THOUSANDS of people in gaza.
Are you seriosuly mixing truth with lies together? That&#39;s just deception!<br>Yes, israel had the germany problems so they had to find a new home that was <b>palestine</b> who were fine with it, but israel later betrayed them more and more that israel now almost fully owns palestine. <b>Palestine defends themselves for the first time</b> and boom! They&#39;re the bad people, great job humanity! Just a sad world we live in and praying for the innocent people in general!
cap cap cap
I hate that people only show the bad sides of these great countries. And I’m not saying that the things that they are doing is good, I’m just saying that good and nice people still exists in these countries, So please free both from their terrible governments 😥
bullshit your mouth.. we don&#39;t trust you anymore..
PAlestine is a refuge for terrorists gorups and Islam . it always has been the bible predicts this stuff ..it says Israel as a nation shell fall and never rise again and it will..with peopel nowadays everyone is pro palestine not knowing the history of these 2 countries and the constant fighting.. in the end it says the Lord will come and fight with his peopel...so i have to side wiht the Jay Cee..hes the saviour.if he fights for Israel i must also hes my saviour and redeemer.. Praise JEsus.. GLory to Ukraine and israel
“Hundreds of people” is dead wrong they killed hundreds of nazis.
WW3 Inbound Sadly Folks
They want they land back. Simple !
Israel are in their homeland. Palestine comes from nowhere.
god put you on this planet not to attack each other...wop heads
Israels’ zionist settler colonialism supported both financially and militarily by US imperialism are the root cause for war and genocide. Israel is a stationary aircraft carrier for the US.
Humans have been killing eachother since adam<br>Sucks
Judea is Jewish original homeland
Israel The Military Base  of the US and UK<br>was established  by the UK and the US To Destabilize the Arab Region and  to Destroy  The Muslim Nations.
Here less than 2 seconds. Palestine wants Palestine without bloodbath.
Palestine was there first , say it with me PALESTINE WAS THERE FIRST!!!!! Give them their land
Oh you seem to have forgotten to include why the war actually started, on October 7th when hamas invaded Israel and slaughtered 1400 jew, the biggest killing of jews since the holocaust
I think hamas did war crimes and hid in populated areas which made israel kill a couple of civillians by accident we never wanted to kill anybody its hamas
Exactly why I get so sick of hearing “Free Palestine”. Neither side is right, yet all these people in the western world want to pick sides. This isn’t your fight, these aren’t your people, nobody deserves praise.
so religion again
JUST PEACE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pxEUbd3fz_Q">https://youtube.com/shorts/pxEUbd3fz_Q?si=s4_vKauBbz887KuL</a>

Both sides are horrible in different ways. Same as every war there has been.
IDF having hard time with Hamas imagine if they had to fight with a military with decent equipment
Most biased news piece I’ve seen in my life
Roman Emperor Hadrian decided to punish the Jews by changing the name of the province from &quot;Judea&quot; to &quot;Palestine.&quot;<br>For the Romans, the name &quot;Palestine&quot; had nothing to do with modern-day Palestinians, who of course did not even remotely exist at the time. The Romans knew the coastal region of the Land of Israel as &quot;Palestine,&quot; which was named after the ancient Philistine people who once inhabited the coastal territory of the Land of Israel.<br> The Philistines disappeared from the history books when the Assyrians conquered and exiled them some 700 years before the Roman period.<br>A 2019 DNA study of skeletons exhumed from Philistine tombs in the coastal Israeli cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon found that the Philistines come from a &quot;southern European gene pool.&quot; In other words, the ancient Philistines have no genetic relation whatsoever to the modern Palestinian-Arabs
No one cares what Palestine and hamas wants... they should have thought about this before now... its toooooooo late!! Its definitely sad that citizens occasionally get caught in the middle but this should have been thought about! Israel will never allow this to happen again! USA stands with Israel forever!!
Jews are the indiguos of the land, jews originally came from Judea which is israel of today. Jews were sitting on this land for over 3000 years and came back to their land. Arab has 23 countries. Jews own their only tiny country that is the same size as new jearsy. Palestinians that was in the area of israrl are job seakers/ work immigrants that came to Israel area from Arab countries slowly slowly from the 19 century. Stop re write history and tell only bits of the history for biased nerative .
Good documentary now why are all the Palestinians in the UK screaming at us and our politicians??
This sounds like a hidden agenda type of situation from the British side. Another bad situation due to greed.
Opinions formed on the genocide is honestly just if someone is thinking of the past, or the present.
Free PALESTINE 🤲🕋🕯️🙏📿🕊️☮️🙏
Jerusalem belongs to the Jews.
Explains alot and been searching history and as a Lebanese i learnt that they are born to be taught evil to us. <br>Idc what side yall on, but dont deny the fact that Israel is evil. They even celebrated the 9/11 attack they were dancing while the people lost their beloved relatives and siblings and family. The police caught them and there were reports of a saying that Jews were behind all yet they blame it on Arabs. Such a shame
Iarael, Palestine and Hamas explained in ten seconds, for Americans:  One side is lying.  The other side is also lying.  Stay out of it, it&#39;s not our business.
Why should I support either side?  Maybe they should be adults and figure out their own problems.  Once they are both gone, we won’t have to hear about them .
2 minutes is not long enough to explain 100 years. Good try though.
The holocaust was done by the west and here innocent Palestinians are paying the price with their lives. If West and Britain wanted to make Israel so bad they should have given their land to jews, why they took Palestinian land and give it to jews without the consent of Palestinians?? THE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS ARE NOW THE OPPRESSORS.
Not gona lie, had to watch this 5 or 6 times to grasp it all
Hamas are basically Nazis
Even in the US who has sided with Israel I understand that there’s two sides to every story and we are being shown Hamas everyday is not an accurate reflection of the truth of Palestinians
Why are so many Americans standing for Palestine? Sounds like hamas threw the first rocket? Please educate me
My question is why are we picking up at 1946 instead of the actual beginning?
Please do not get your news from the news
Simple Answer: Hamas wants people to die
Well, they tried to help the jews and looked what happened... both are wrong and both end lifes. Two wrongs dont make a right
So if you don’t believe in their religion you should die???
Imagine a thief and criminal broke into a house and managed to evict the family and killed some of its members to give the house to a European gang . How would the court in the UK deal with this case ? If you were the judge how would you deal with it honestly?
Ok lets be real none will say the truth israel have no damage hamas is trying to get their right and ISRAEL KILLING PALESTINIANS HAMAS KILLES 100 WHILE ISRAEL KILLED 30000 WHERE IS THE HUMAN RIGHTS IN THAT ITS LIKE I DESTROY YOUR HOME WINDOW YOU KILL AND DESTROY MY WHOLE HOME AND FAMILLY WHY NONE IS SAYING THE TRUTH BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA CANT BE EVEN HONNEST WITH YOURSELF
My name Muhammad oyalowo and messi and ocean of back from you with your email 📧 and hope that you have an okay
So if it didn’t happen till when she said it did where did Moses take the Jews when he parted the sea🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
There is only one rabbi and master and his name is Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth. God so loved the world that He sent his only Son so that whosoever believe in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. Repent and turn to Him, kingdom of God is at hand. Read Mathew, Luke, Mark and John Gospels and get to know what Lord Jesus is teaching. God bless!
You are telling the stpry very manuplitive and wrong
Why jews can not pray kn tgeir mist holy cite? Sounds insane
They throw ied&#39;s out the windows.  And rocks.
Subhan Allah!
I cry for the children of Gaza trapped in the Holocaust. The air, sea and ground bombardment does not stop for a single moment and has been for more than four months.
NEW ERA OF THE THIRD TEMPLE FOR THE DIVINE TRUTH OF HOLY SPIRIT OF ONE NEW GLOBAL BODY OF PEACEFULNESS OF MORTAL MANKIND...
Nothing you have explained from this video. No history.  Only arrogance information

The third temple is already there now, they just wont accept it. They won&#39;t submit to the greater truth!  They won&#39;t accept their last Prophet!
No comment about what christi-anity calls it?
Shame on hamas.
Would be mildly amusing if the western wall was merely part of a Roman fortress long since forgotten…
Religion is never a good thing.
They (gazzas) attacked and laughed. Now they are lost and flattened, cried and asked for sympathy?<br>What you sow you reap?,..,
Hopefully it does not end up like the oldest church in Palestine...
Jews should be allowed to build their temple in place of Al Aqsa... It&#39;s not fair to steal from Jews.., Same has happened in India and now slowly India is reclaiming it&#39;s lost Hindu temples.., Thanks to our beloved Prime Minister Modi ji❤
Thank you for this. Be blessed friends.
Where is Jordan during this situation?
thanks for the amazing video that describes the situation
Stand for PALESTINE ❤❤❤
And why do you regard Jewish prayers in Al Aqsa as a violation? It is just a place of prayer ! You can go there and cite the prayer of Islam, Judaism or Christianity!
Jews need to believe that yes your time of denial of God sending Jesus has already come.
You can be Pro Israel and anti Netanyahu and his War
Isra&#39; and Mi&#39;raj are thought to have happened before the Hijrah (622 C.E.), while there is no evidence of a masjid/mosque (in terms of a structure) in Jerusalem until after Caliph Umar arrived to build one sixteen years later (638 C.E.).
It&#39; s more then that. It &#39;s about to destroy Al Aqsa compound, to build 3rd temple, instal their Jewish &quot;messiah&quot; then impose and implement talmudic Noahtide Laws on whole world with inststalled anti - christ to rule the whole world from Jerusalem in one world AI dystopian order. Jews rejected Jesus and New Covenant, gave Jesus to pontie Pilate to be murdered.
THIS IS ISLAMIC STATE RUN TV no wonder its so whacked.
See here they don&#39;t want to share with anyone else. They want control of it all and to subjugate everyone. and even in this story she states that it is the holiest place of the Jews.  it belongs to the Jews.the Masque was built way later as an insult.
There are 8 entrances only  not anyone else.
You believe that Muhammad flew around on a magic horse?  Seriously? and the al aqsa Masque is off limits to Jews.
Yes things did get heated and security increased after the second intifada , which was a series of attacks on Israeli civilians, by Hamas and Islamic jihadists , including stabbings, suicide bombings, blowing up buses, attacks on cafes,  car rammings, the Passover massacre and on and on
they pushed the envelope right into oct 7th.
thank you Romans and Babylonians
Three holy sights - Islam , Christian and Judaism-  Religion mixed with political power- has caused violence and instability. Today - maybe Israel and Palestine could live two independent states but with when it comes to rights of aqsa compound,etc this will be a fight until the end of the world. Shame people do not understand how a volcano erupts- due underground instability , temperature changes, geological changes - volcan always erupts so often, Until the deep roots of of christianity, islamic and judaism ideology target the true peace in terms of political, religion and power sharing - it is a total loss even with United nations, and other world organisations. A common goal is achieved when different  group people view the lens from the same angle.
Yet the Hamas Terrorists want to destroy it.
Al Jazeera reporters are dying so that we can know the truth about what&#39;s happening in Palestine. CNN doesn&#39;t.
The spoils of war should never have been conceded or a part of any negotiation. Israel&#39;s mistake.
The main alaqsa area is with the blackdome while the gold dome often called the dome of the rock is focused more while the whole area is sacred aswell.
When I was there about 10 years ago, I&#39;ve seen Arabs go there, and when we (American tourists) tried to go there, out guide have said it was ok, we got surrounded by local Arabs that were screaming and spitting at us.   So we left.  That was my personal experience.
The Temple Mount has NOTHING to do with the false prophet mohmmed or the fake god allah or the false religion of islam, and all anti Israel protesters are ignorant and do not know what they stand for. There is NO nation called palistine and never has been, and Israel owns Gaza and Israel is fighting a terrorist group who attacked them called hamas which puts the people living in Gaza in harms way by using them as human shields in hospitals etc, while they attack the peaceful nation of Israel for no reason except that they hate Jewish people and God. This is a SPIRITUAL WAR. Satan hates God so Satan and his people will always attack Israel and the Jewish people and God because Israel is the nation that God created through which to give the world our Savior Jesus Christ, Israel is the nation through which God revealed Himself to the fallen pagan world to as the ONE True Living God of all of creation.<br><br>Satan and his people will also always fight over Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, because Jerusalem is the city that God chose to represent heaven on earth, the Holy Bible tells us that the eternal heaven is called the &quot;New Jerusalem.&quot; The Temple mount has NOTHING to do with the false prophet mohammed or with the fake god allah or with the false religion of islam, all false religions and fake gods come from Satan. Satan and his people will also always attack Christians because true born again Christians are God&#39;s true church on earth and they follow Jesus Christ and they have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.<br><br>We must remember that this is our temporary home separated from God for a short period of time because of sin, but all people who believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the Holy Bible and accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior by believing that Jesus was God on earth Who died to pay for our sins for us and resurrected from the dead to defeat eternal death for us and believe that Jesus is coming back again to set up His eternal kingdom, will be forgiven of their sins and have eternal life reconciled with God.<br><br>Read the entire Gospel of Jesus Christ in the Holy Bible in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.<br><br>THE GOSPEL (THE GOOD NEWS) OF JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD AND SAVIOR -<br><br>Jesus Christ came down here from heaven, God on earth, to be born one of us His own creation and He dwelt among us for over three decades and He taught us about God and His eternal heavenly kingdom and how to live righteously and He lived a perfect sinless life. Then He gave His sinless life to all people from all nations to pay for our sins for us, by dying on cross and resurrecting from the dead three days later, to take the punishment for our sins for us to defeat eternal death for us to reconcile us sinners with God to give us eternal life with Him, and after He resurrected from the dead to defeat death for us, He lived on earth for forty more days, speaking with many people, then He ascended back up into heaven, and He is coming back again at the end of this world to set up His eternal heavenly kingdom for all people who believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the Holy Bible and accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, to live in for the rest of eternity, forgiven of their sins and reconciled with God.
All of their problems stem from the illegal occupation. The US UK and Israel are responsible.
I stand with Palestine 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 Palestine 🇵🇸  shal winn Inshallah
I’m so very tired of the two medieval approaches that are being taken toward one another in Israel/Palestine.   Theocracy and the use of religion as a guide to governance is outdated, limits human liberty in service to matters of conscience i. Ways it shouldn’t and only creates friction between groups who cling to their backward customs more dearly than they do their lives. The region needs to enter the 21st century, relinquish all the religious and ethnic hatred and have one, unified, modern, secular democratic state defined by equality for all and privilege for none.  The Israeli government needs to abandon theocracy and inequality and the Palestinians need to have the 1967 borders restored, all illegal settlements vacated and to receive compensation for all their land seized by force since 1948.
Nice propaganda! Well done👏
try telling the truth.   One the city was only divided in 48 because Jordan land grab that was never recognized .   Two Jordan has failed to prevent damage to mount and attacks from the mount.   Rocks have rained down on people below .   If the mount is holy to the Muslim than why have they ripped up paving stones to throw off the mount.   Why has Jordan leaders done an said nothing about weapon being secreted into the mosque.     The agreement in 67 was meant to make peace and yet Jordan and the Palestinians have used it as a club and fake causes to keep the war going on.
I pray peace between the two countries.
This is SO biased. But see whose video this is. And this was all built on top of a holy Jewish site.
I hate Ben Gvir, but on this he is not wrong. Not allowing Jews to visit THEIR HISTORIC temple mount, is not only racist, but absurd on its face. If it’s holy for all 3 religions, then all 3 religions should be allowed to visit. Muslim supremacy is not cool.
Islam can have 3 holy sites but Judaism can&#39;t even have 1?<br>This report supports that Jews are the earliest and original owners of the compound and the mosque only came in to being after the Romans destroyed the Jewish temple amd forced many of the Jews into exile into Europe, leaving their Homeland.<br><br>In my opinion, Palestine are tenants! Tenants who occupied the area because the original landlords were chased away by a bigger military power.<br><br><br>Before you come to criticize this view, ask your self these questions;  if the Romans had not destroyed the Jewish temple and forced jews into exile, would the Al aqsa mosque have been built there regardless of if the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven from that spot?<br>If the Jews were not displaced from their homeland at first, would it have been easy or even possible for the prophet Muhammad to have Journeyed to that spot in order to ascend to heaven?<br><br>Give the Jews back their lands!<br>These people have been persecuted enough already!
This is very sad 😢😢
And they say GOD is GOOD!  yes he is, that is why he allows all the suffering in the world especially little kids.<br>COME ON GIVE YOUR HEADS A SHAKE THERE IS NO GOD AND RELIGON HAS KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN  ANY CONVENTIONAL WARS !
Beduins have nothing to do in Jerusalem. Their presence is due to a false dream by Qathem abd al Lat in 622, who thought he was carried on a flying mule. But the place was built only in 637 !<br>YHVH&#39;s temple shall be rebuilt whatever it costs
From an outsider perspective, it seems like limiting prayer at the site to Muslim prayer is very selfish, and for Israeli government officials like Ben-Gvir to act with defiance and disrespect is arrogant. It should probably just be open to everyone to pray, visit, and treat with respect.
Jews deserve a country.
Americans, British, Germans and French are unanimous in maintaining the occupation of Palestine. For this, they arm, finance and supply their ally Israel; while turning a blind eye to the genocides perpetrated in the land of Palestine. These countries are openly the sworn enemies of Arab nation made up of Arab peoples who are also kept in a state of slavery by dictatorial regimes supported by these imperialist countries which are at the origin of all the misfortunes of the world. These countries which hold economic power and military power are for the moment invincible and no one can stop them from defending crimes committed by Zionists. But a glimmer of hope has been lit by the mobilization of people of the West who have finally understood what&#39;s going on behind them by their fascist leaders who are imposed on them by the international Zionist cartel.
In Japan, we do not come across such reporting. I appreciate your post🙏🙏
Also known as Satans temple
No mosque in Israel Holy Land during the time of muhammad even on the so called night journey.<br>The muslim claims is invalid because of lies.
Omg im aqsa
If the world, in its wisdom, had been willing to offer the Jewish people a safe haven after the holocaust, this entire situation would never have arisen. The world, unfortunately, refused to accept Jewish refugees, even when Hitler offered them before the war, and Israel became the only option for people who had nowhere else to  go.  Now we are seeing the consequences. It could all have been averted with a little compassion and foresight.
I have traveled the world fairly extensively and have noticed that in many places where Islam conquered, local religious sites were destroyed or appropriated, and mosques built on top of them. Why is Jerusalem different?
❤️‍🔥🔥🥰❄️✌️💪🕊️🙏✝️ CHRIST HAS RISEN ☦️🙏⛪️🌟☃️🫶🥰🙌❤️
Since the KJ Bible was controlled by King James of England, why do so many humans believe that it is the word of God? <br>Especially now that it is widely known that Sir Francis Bacon (Shakespeare) tampered with it, why do so many still believe?<br>It appears that with the passing of Queen Elizabeth has led to the internal destruction of the British Empire’s (former 😂) colonies.<br>Will the reality of all that spell the eventual end of Christianity as we know it?<br>If so, what will fill it’s void — the Climate Change agenda and their worship of Mother Earth?<br>If so, won’t the elite’s Climate Change agenda eventually destroy the prosperity of the oil-rich nations that identify as Muslim?<br>And how will the elite’s climate change agenda affect the safety of Israel in the Middle East, if America is weakened?<br>And if the Green Agenda eventually destroys the economies of America and the West, how will that affect the elites that prosper from it?<br>And if the West becomes poorer, how will that ultimately affect the economy of China?<br>And if the economy of China flounders, how will that affect the security and safety of Xi and the CCP?<br>I could just go on, and on, and on……

Islamic empire is doing big mistake by invaded Jerusalem Israel long times ago and they bulit the mosque at Jews Holly site compound
Building your church on someone else&#39;s holiest site is the very definition of f u. What kind of person are you, who supports this? They&#39;ve been like this for ages too. Filling in the east gate is trying to do the same thing. They have a lot of hatred and everybody can see that.

very authentic

My prayers are with Palestine!!
As an Indonesian muslim we all told by our oarents that this is ocupation from the start, so from the start 1948 till now and forever will alaways be supporting palestinian by our generation. We also build INDONESIAN HOSPITAL where no our goverment involve. Pure funding from muslim society. And were ready to defend al aqsa Insya Allah.
Israel start the invasion in 1967, not Palestinian not Hamas
Free the kidnaped <br>Hostages <br>Philestines
There is NO M0SQUE in Jerusalem during the so called night journey,
Al-Agsa was build after muhammad died 60 years later, how can he visited and went to heaven from Al-Agsa mosque!?
Israel prepared poison gas for Hamas tunnels after the emission of Israeli hostages. That was Israel&#39;s deceptive tactic in the war.
To the question, “How much do you support the military operation carried out by the Palestinian resistance led by Hamas on October 7th?” 59.3 per cent supported it strongly, with another 15.7 per cent of people supporting it somewhat — a combined total of 75 per cent backing the slaughter of men, women and children.<br><br>The Oct. 7 attacks are widely attributed to Hamas, but more specifically, it is likely that it was Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, that carried out the raid.<br><br>And how do Palestinians view the Qassam Brigades? The poll found that 79.1 per cent of Gazans had a positive view of the organization and, in the West Bank, that grew to 95.4 per cent. As for Hamas, almost 60 per cent of Gazans had a positive view of it, with that number rocketing to 87.7 per cent in the West Bank.<br><br>Islamic Jihad, which like Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization in Canada, is supported by 71.9 per cent of Gazans and over 90 per cent of people in the West Bank. And to finish the role call of terror groups, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades is viewed positively by almost 70 per cent of Gazans and over 80 per cent of West Bank respondents.
Themuslims built amosque in someone else&#39;s religious site - again. whats new?

Headquarter of the knights of the temple !
What year was this mosque built? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb3v8M8dzic&amp;t=129">2:09</a>
bit biast of a of a take if i do say so myself. not that I&#39;m very un biast myself but personally i belive it has everything with the information i have with the situation. cause like the idea that jews don&#39;t worship at the mount because a rabbi in 1967 said its too holy is just silly. Itamar Ben-Gvir is somewhat correct that it is discriminitory against them. the rule does not exist cause its to holy or to close to the dead. its cause they don&#39;t want to provoke conflict. the proof for this is that now jews do pray there in &quot;secret&quot; and in the past they could be killed for just praying at the wall. also bit of a richard move to build a temple on top of the previous jewish temple.
So to Worship GOD.. People kill each other?<br>Am I Right??

Does it not break your heart that for 40 years they&#39;ve sent their children against IDF soldiers, sent them to weapon camps from age 4?

Well, 14,000 Palestinians literally <b>are</b> children who have been murdered by Israel now, in the last 5 months alone. I think it’s fair to say Israel is literally fighting against children with bombs at this point.
muslimin never want to lose anything the only way to handle them is you have to be stronger than them
❤ Israel ❤ Bring them home! ❤ Never again! ❤

Plastilin State: Iran&#39;s Global Power Grab.
You are a very brave character
And to think this was years ago now we are witnessing Israel committing Genocide against Palestine and they did crush Gaza. This was all planned
boring.
Why are you guys so silent this time around?
&quot; When you have this much power, what is your responsibility?&quot; Prescient words. Free Palestine
He explained the solution of this history of conflict
The person is very concious. <br>He is what he brought the truth
Reminds me of a comment about Israel made years ago, A country that wanted to be Athens that ended  up being Sparta&quot;
sounds to me israel IS the bad guy
I would LOVE to find a way to be in touch with Trevor Noah.  I created three PPTs/a discussion for my community here in the Massachusetts with the title, &quot;Antisemitism is at the heart of white nationalism.&quot;  In the 2nd one, I dedicated four slides to Trevor Noah&#39;s book Born a Crime in which he totally got Jewishness wrong.  Likewise, there is so much wrong about this video.  I used to watch Trevor Noah/The Daily Show every night.  I stopped doing so after this video.  I told everyone I knew to boycott it.  I would be happy to share with you what I wrote about Trevor Noah and to connect with you (email or messaging).  Thanks, Fern
😅😅😅 white people versus rhythm
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
A 73 year old &quot;beef&quot;.  Um....I think you&#39;re missing several centuries in there....
how could the first cavemen be Palestinian and Israel when Israel was formed in 1948...
Where is he now? He is very quite. He is more concern about the ticket sales for his shows and presenting at Grammy Awards than being the person he &#39;pretended&#39; to be. It was all BS about humanity and values that he told on this show. I have so much respect for John Cusack and Mark Ruffalo to speak out about humanity, freedom and justice for all!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23onedeadchildonetoomany">#OneDeadChildOneTooMany</a>
But if you can&#39;t beat me why are insisting on doing it its disrespectful and the situation is not the same at all
What Trevor noah is saying is Palestinians are Hamas
Your first mistake is assuming this &quot;conflict&quot; is &quot;73 years old&quot;.
I don&#39;t agree at all !!   the Bad guy is the zionists from the beginnin to the end.
I love him deeply , but ......as usual from &quot;Outstanders &quot; its easy to quest ........No, I don&#39;t know the answer ! But I&#39;m curious to know what&#39;s his position at the moment seeing one one the most corrupt countries (at the moment)  with very very deep racial story has the courage to take the position of &quot;Palistine &quot; Non existing besides the roman &quot;Palestina Syria&quot; label ........
And yet this is more than 2yrs old. 🤦🏾‍♂️
He a black south African.  . . .apparently 😢😅
Its not contentious you plum
Arabs and Jews are literally descendants of one prophet Abraham... They&#39;re brothers...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeZ4yXyzUG0&amp;t=343">5:43</a> yeap they did that...
The British didn&#39;t took the land from Palestinians, but from Arabs and Turks (the than rulers) ..........
Palestine should surrender.
There’s another question…. Why does Hamas continue to fire rockets and missiles from schools, apartments and civilian occupied buildings? The Israelis will- WILL fire back when fired upon. The Israelis send a warning message to the people in the area to let them know they WILL be bombing, giving area occupants time to remove themselves out of harms way. Hamas knows they are putting innocent people in harms way. Why are the people staying once they are warned that the Israelis are firing back? I believe it’s the 2 government forces that maintain the hate and the fight. I know too many Israelis that want peace. They sing songs with their children of having tea with their enemy. They believe a leader will come and bring peace between the two states. There is a large Arab population that lives IN Israel. They live peaceably.
Ahhhhh so THATS why he’s not doing the daily show anymore
100% true
Looking at this in 2024, it&#39;s tragic to see how well-intentioned Western people didn&#39;t realize the Likudnik, settler mindset and intent. Because of the settler movement&#39;s power, Israel never had any will to deescalate and seek peace, it forced the PLO to surrender and just kept going.
Thank you brother. I appreciate you. <br>Ima  a historian.  I know this history <br>Very complex history of this part of this part of the world
Religion is the one thing that has never calmed any situation when there&#39;s a clash. <br><br>True. Religion is the gas that&#39;s thrown on the embers to ignite the fire.
And this is why you lost your job! Woww
This is food for thought. If Nethanyahu was really worried about the Israëlian hostages,then he would have responded differently. He could use the threat of bombing Gaza as a way to let Hamas release hostages.<br>The way Israël responded was exactly how Hamas thought they would. By bombing and killing many Palestinians resulting in what we are wittnessing now has a backfire on Israël. Hamas is a terrorist organisation as is the fascists Zionists government of Israël under Nethanyahu, a terrorist organisation. Both need to be stopped!!!
Like if you’re here after 10-7-2023.
Its so sad to see this video now… after the recent, very evident display of abuse of power 🙏pray for palestine
In a post October 7th reality, would you still say &quot;They can&#39;t hurt Israelis?&quot; What a joke this video is.
No lands were taken from Palestinians  by the  British as there were no Palestinians  then .
Tnx Trevor. Nicely done 👍
I just hard  to say what is in my mind  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsfv1AcAAvY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsfv1AcAAvY</a>
Trevor with all due respect but you are simplifying  and saying so much BS . Please educate yourself  properly without taking sides if ypu want to be respected  journaliats, all what you say and show is limited footage, one  sided.<br><br>You just create  a propaganda.<br><br>Google a bit history and go back to 2 AD , as its easy to say who is wrong who is right
Its not difficult. Stick to facts
Hamas slaughtered Netanyahu opposing lsraeli leftists in several kibbuzim and on a peace festival. Imagine jews slaughtering Sophie Scholl and her friends during the holocaust, same thing. Pali islamists are on the wrong side of history, no excuses!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SazutwDaEg">https://youtu.be/8SazutwDaEg?si=F0cUwhXK0DtYLZRQ</a><br><br>Dear Trevor. You are welcome to hear an answer to the questions you raised. Be the Force with you.
If I go with your analogue of children: the Palestinians are not small kids in the neighborhood, but trouble-making bullies, who are paid by others (Iran and some Arabs countries) to make trouble in the neighborhood (Middle East). Everybody in the Middle East knows it. No Arab country wants Palestinians, because they are afraid of them starting to do troubles in their country. Take the example of Jordan: 1970-71 Palestinians started fights with Jordanians (bombing, shooting, et) but the Jordanian King was wise enough to depress these uprisings. What about Egypt? In the past Israel proposed to Egypt on multiple occasions to take control over Gaza but they repeatedly refused. They are right. Who wants to deal with Palestinians –professional terrorists, bullies, murderers for a higher price, who are looking to destabilize the whole Middle East?
It really isn’t that difficult
Completely agree with the children example.
absolutely perfect question. thanks Trevor.
Respectfully, I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s happening such that Mr. Noah is silent on the Nabka
IN THE BEGINNING JEWS CAME TO PALESTINE. SOUNDS LIKE HOW THE U.S. GOT STARTED. NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT HOW VERY SIMILAR THE TWO EVENTS ARE AND THE COMMON FACTORS!
to me is clear who is the bad guy. <br>iam not saying the other team in totally inocente but the answer to oppresion always will be fight back.
IDGAF, just came to say that 😎
Of course, you are sided with pro hamas and of course you mention dying children without mentioning that they are used a the tool, currency, weapon and shield for terrorists. And of course you call terrorists a fighters,  militia group, anything but terrorists.
If you think Gaza belongs to Palestine that’s fine, what’s NOT fine is that belief justifying Hamas invading Israel first, which they did, horrifically. Israel is fighting BACK against Hamas, while Hamas was trying to wipe out civilians in the name of their country’s “freedom”
😂 Noah, when you go way back in time, those two cavemen hitting each other were brothers.  The two groups have more in common than with the Europeans or the Africans, or the Asians, yet they hate each other.  It is very sad in a very foolish way.
This is one of the dumbest takes I&#39;ve ever seen.  Essentially:  &quot;What does it matter who instigated the attack, the nation with the more powerful military should be the one holding back&quot;.  That&#39;s some deep thinking right there.
What can we expect from a people who have suffered almost 80 years of oppression and racism and whose lands are seized by the Zionists, of course the resistance!!<br>Israel is therefore a victim of its victims🤷<br>שיהיה לך יום טוב
Beautifully said Trevor. Couldn’t agree more. Thank you
Syetanyahoe not in gaza...😂😂??<br>pedicure....creambath saloon...😂??<br>ohhh...fool soldier...😂😂??<br>lost...or.....died...😂😂??<br>....????
Brilliant insight that, tragically, is still so relevant. Thank you Mr. Noah.
The isrealis did everything right, gave Palestinians official positions within the Israeli government, gave Israeli citizenship to Palestinians, granted LGBT rights to its citizens, brought in thousands of foreign refugees, even gave Hamas/PLO another chance, and then it all comes down to nothing as they where attacked and now being slandered and dragged through the mud by their allies and their own citizens, well no more mister nice guy huh Israel? The kiddy gloves come off and the isrealis we know from the bible come to the light and fight to win.
(((💖!)))
Go back 75 years when these immigrants hadn’t yet landed in Palestine! I’m not even Muslim but I’m not blind either
Way more Nazis/German civilians died during WW2. Does that mean they were right and we should&#39;ve just let them be?
The most real Daily show, unlike the other clowns
I agree. But I cannot share this video or any of my thoughts on Palestine-Israel conflict because an overwhelming majority of my FB friends and compatriots hold a very vocal and visibly painful for them pro-Israeli position and I don’t want to be ostracised
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SazutwDaEg">https://youtu.be/8SazutwDaEg?si=J9sw48JKq4Ent8jD</a>
One of the only true things Trevor has said. Im a very republican person🤣
so.. Palestinians &quot;can&#39;t hurt&quot; Israelis because of the power imbalance? Tell that to 1500 grieving families. Yes Israel is stronger and can inflict more death. But that doesn&#39;t mean it needs to &quot;not retaliate&quot; when its people are killed. idiotic take with a well-meaning &quot;oh gosh idk im just trying to help&quot; face
The British didn&#39;t take the land from the Palestinians, as Trevor Noah said at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeZ4yXyzUG0&amp;t=164">2:44</a>.  They took the land from the Ottoman Turks. Well actually the League of Nations allowed the British to administer the land as a Palestinian Mandate - a future homeland for the Jews.  All of this was before the Nazis, by the way, despite what Noah implies. <br><br>So why are people viewing commentary from a person who clearly didn&#39;t even do a wikipedia search on the history there?<br><br>There has never been - at any point - a Palestinian Arab state in the region we now call Israel.  Indeed there has never been a Palestinian Arab state at all, except the one also formed by the British, Jordan.  And if you&#39;re wondering why all the refugees can&#39;t just go there, you might want to look into Black September and the events that preceded and caused it, when the PLO assassinated the Jordanian prime minister.<br><br>By the way, just since 2000, the Palestinian Arabs have been offered point blank their own state by Israel three separate times, and I&#39;m not even counting the unilateral Israeli decision to give Gaza over and forcibly expel all the Jews from the area.  But despite anything you might have heard, the Palestinian Arabs have shown no interest - ever - in having a state <b>alongside</b> Israel and at peace with her.
Do they bomb schools in America under school shootings with a warning signal?
Breaking HUMAN RIGHT LAWS constantly under ilegall occupation how is THAT COMPLICATED!!!!!???? <br><br>They become a state without Palestinians/Arabs having anything to say about it!!
1. The British did not take the land from Palestinians the Ottoman Empire control the land 400 years and there where never Palestinians it was Arabic people living in the territory called Palestine.<br>2. What did he say about they can’t hurt you ? I wonder if he thinks the same after October 7 th .<br>I wonder if he expects Israel not to retaliate now ?
Remember this USA citizen
True. I know that Israel is the stronger of the two so to many it seems like they’re punching down…but that seems like some kind of fallacy because in a way that’s saying no one should ever win. Like, if Palestinians get stronger and start winning, they’ll be punching down too.<br><br>Like, if two sports teams go head to head, no one would tell the team that’s winning to ease up to allow the other team a chance to win. That’s not the point. <br><br>Bc if the underdog starts winning, they’re not the underdog…and then you can’t root for them. You gotta root for the new underdog. It’s so ridiculous. Just keeps flip flopping lol.
Palestine was at peace with  Jews, Muslims, and Christians of all races living together with no problem.........until 1947.  That&#39;s when the problem started and the worst violation of International Law began to happen and has been going on for 75 years.  .......and the United States and Britain are complicit.    War crimes and genocide.   Pure and simple,  not complicated.
You should do thorough research on this, and any other topic for that matter. <br><br>During apartheid our struggle was against colonialism, racism and the dehumanisation of the indigenous people. This is the same struggle of the Palestinian people. <br><br>Israel is an occupying, settler and terrorist people. That&#39;s the reality of the matter.<br><br>Listen to the lectures of Professor Noam Chomsky, a Jew from the US. You&#39;ll benefit alot.<br><br>If you are unable to do thorough research rather stick to comedy because you cannot try to satisfy both sides.
So well spoken. This is how I feel and couldn&#39;t put it into words.
You forgot that they are children of Abraham. Sibling rivalry
Trying to state Palestine and israel as a conflict is so manipulating. Its much more simple as Zionist try to portray. Palestine was a country that holds Muslim Christian and Jewish Palestinians. In 1948 Britain decided to help make a Israel state then the nakba came where Palestinian were forced out of there homes and land through straight violence and acts of terror . Finally if this is not clear enough that israel is a terrorist filthy state and should not have even existed since its existence started by war crimes , genocide and ethnic cleansing then you should learn about humanity . Free Palestine
“They can’t hurt you”. If only that were true.
if Americans see January 6 completely different and it happened just three years ago with multiple angles televised live,<br><br>can you imagine this over 70 year old conflict of existence? It’s tragic.
Thank you, Traver. I&#39;ve to be very careful so that my comment doesn&#39;t get shadow-banned or taken down.<br>The powerful country that you speak of hasn&#39;t just taken over that little powerless county next door, in my opinion, they have even taken over the US. In the US, no one has the guts to speak the truth and point out the enormous injustice that has taken place, because if they do, they risk losing everything. In the US, you can think and say whatever you like about any politician, yet one does not dare to mansion the name of one of them (people from the powerful country). One small piece of evidence of their absolute power and control over the US is this very comment, I just can&#39;t write it in a normal way and can&#39;t express my opinion like a normal person due to the fear of being band or losing my account and access. So, basically, get in line and support them or get the heck out.
Thanks for watching!<br><br>Please remember to be polite in the comments. Any comments that we consider to be offensive or aggressive will be removed.
the jews should never have colonized palestine. periodT
&#39;Israel&#39; today has no recognition in English Law: Neither &#39;Balfour Declaration&#39; nor &#39;Palestine Mandate&#39; ever formed part of English Law: All three came from Britain&#39;s illegal war on Germany in 1914, which breached our 1848 Treason Felony Act. Palestine entering British Empire in 1917 was thus unlawful, unconstitutional, and remains unlawful today: It has to be given back to Palestinian Arabs
There would be peace today if jordan army had not crossed the jordan river in 1948 and colonized judea, samaria and east jersusalem.<br>In 1948 after Israel declared independence (end of british rule), Jordan army crossed the Jordan river into Judea &amp; Samaria (known as the west bank by MSM) and east Jerusalem. The Jordan army killed or drove away the Jewish people. The Jordan army then destroyed Jewish property or took it over. Jordan then encouraged Jordanian settlement in the occupied land. Jewish property not destroyed became occupied by Jordanians. After the Israeli victory in 1967 and Jordnian disillusionment with their expansion effort (1988), Jordan revoked the Jordanian citizenship of &quot;palestinians&quot; in Judea &amp; Samaria (known as the west bank by MSM) and east Jerusalem. For the most part &quot;palestinians&quot; are leftover Jordanian colonist (Gaza residents more closely tied to Egypt). The homeland of the majority of &quot;palestinians&quot; is Jordan.
From the Axis powers? He went to see Hitler...well documented...Truth in its entirety please.
&quot;The Palestinian people do not exist. There are no differences between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. We are part of one people, the Arab nation. Lo and behold, I have relatives with Palestinian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Syrian citizenship. We are one people. It is only for political reasons that we carefully endorse our Palestinian identity. Indeed, it is of national interest for the Arabs to encourage the existence of the Palestinians in the face of Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity is only for tactical reasons. The establishment of a Palestinian state is a new means to continue the struggle against Israel and for Arab unity.&quot;<br>Zuheir Mohsen (1936 – 25 July 1979) was a Palestinian leader of the Syria-controlled as-Sa&#39;iqa faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) between 1971 and 1979.
The Jewish population of Palestine was 10% in 1918. <br>The British allowed mass migration to raise European Jewish population and total Jewish minority of Palestine to 33% in 1948. These are not Palestinian Jews, but colonizing Europeans, largely armed and trained by UK. <br>Then Zionist terrorists were rewarded with a nation, by far away nations, against the wishes of all local nations, and with zero regard for Palestinians’ self determination.
If you pay attention the “Jewish resistance” was called a terrorist group in the news of the hotel bombing, now they are praised in Israel for their participation in the “independence”. That sounds familiar these days…
There was and is no Palestine.
I think its hard to understand 1939. How scary it really was. Having entire nations fall.And people just gone. What if Germany had won? We can overlook the war. But should not. We are to close to wars again.
A sophomoric book report.  What this documentary fails to address is the historical betrayal of the Arabs of the Levant.  The &quot;intelligentsia&quot; of that day was so adamant about the emerging state being &quot;moderate&quot; that the word &quot;Palestine&quot; was preferred over the truth.  The Levant has only ever been known by the residents of this region by five names, and never all at once.  Cannan, Midian, Israel, Judea and, finally, Samaria.  Palestine is, itself, a Helenistic exonymn inherited by Rome from Alexander the Great&#39;s maps.  It was the &quot;Purples&quot; or Phonecians (Tyreans) which brough Caesar&#39;s ire down on the region, and as we all know, Caesar destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem, then exiled everyone associated with the Herrodian Kingdom of Judea.  Despite what Jews insist, they were not all dispursed across Europe, just their aristocracy, Nobility and Clergy, anyone capable of leading the resistance to Caesarean authority.  The majority of Judeans (Jews) remained, though made no attempt to reconstitute a Civil authority after Caesar&#39;s apartheid regime fell.  That was a serious mistake since a state without a government is easily confused with no state at all.   During the Islamic Caliphates and the Ottoman Empire, Jews and Muslims lived side by side with no existential struggle between them, at least not on a scale experienced in the 20th century.  The problem for Muslims of the Levant is that the promise of the Caliphates and the Ottoman Empire is that both regimes pursued a single state, one defined by theological borders, one which obscured all pre-Islamic &quot;nations&quot; (Kingdoms).  When the Ottoman Empire failed, Arabs in all other regions restored their traditional Monarchs and asserted their traditional status as Kingdoms. Muslims of the Levant had no historical context to which they could resort.  The Muslims and Israelite Samaritans of the &quot;Northern Kingdo of Israel&quot; pre-empted a return to that historical obscurity by declaring independence as Lebannon, in Abramic origins, Lebanon is just the defeated, Northern Kingdom of Israel.   If you are saying that Israelis have no historical claim to &quot;Northern Israel&quot;, you are correct.   That divorce was final in 600 BC, though the region remained an &quot;autonomous vassal&quot; of Asyria until Caesar invaded and occupied the Levant.   Which brings me to the people we call &quot;Palestinians&quot; today.  Who are they?  Palestinians are Muslims living in the former Kingdom of Judea the day Britain abstained from casting a vote to decide the regions fate.   I believe Britain&#39;s Abstention is the wisest decision the British Crown ever made.  But history has indeed dealt the &quot;Palestinians&quot; a cruel fate, for they were effectively rendered without a legitimate identity by an &quot;inteligentsia&quot; more invested in subtextual rhetoric.  Given the choice between being called Midian and being called Palestine, Muslims of the former Kingdom of Judea chose to abandone their father, Abraham in favor of a listing in the &quot;P&quot; section of the international directory.  Today, Palestinians of Israel (the only Palestinians in the world by the way) find themselves with no true advocates among their Muslim brothers and sisters.  Gazans are reeling in shock that their violent rising against Israel on October 7th was not a pan-Arabian call to arms to drive Israelis all into the sea.  Gazans should not be surprised they are without allies in this atrocity because no place called Palestine has ever existed until the Israelis of the Levant reassert self governance.  Israel, even the Koran acknowledges, has existed precisely where it is, for millenia.  Arabia&#39;s Muslims are many things, but they are not fools. Arabs know their children will inherit this lie called Palestine. Palestinians will remain friendless in the region until they acknowledge their Father, Abraham and restore their birthright as Midianites.  I do believe in a two state solution: Israel &amp; Midian.  Palestine is a nightmare based on a semantic allusion, a nightmare which should be brought to a peaceful conclusion. Amen.
Good video. couple of errors: 1) The number of Jews expelled from Arab lands after 1949 was over half a million. 2)  Israeli Arabs enjoy full equal rights together with Jews
While, depending on one&#39;s perspective, one can find issue with one aspect or another of the presentation, overall I found it to be informative and balanced -- an impossible scenario steeped in tragedy.  Perhaps more mention could have been made of the Jewish fighters who were not merely trained by Britain -- they composed the Jewish Brigade that was active in So. Europe, 1944-45.  In any case, kudos to the presenter and the Imperial War Museums.
Change the name to:<br>A&#39;AZA-zell
The &#39;West Bank&#39; is Judea, the ancient land of the Jews. <br><br>The Jews are from Judea, where the Judean mountains runs along the spine of Israel, where the tribe of Judah had its tribal allotment. The Jews are the native people of the Holy Land. The ‘Philistines’ came from the Greek Isles, originally; these modern ‘Palestinians’ have no relation to them at all. They are Persian, Egyptian, Bedouin, Turkish, Syrian, &amp; Arabian, mostly.<br><br>The term &#39;West Bank&#39; is a modern term with no historical significance. There was never a country called &#39;Jordan&#39; before the modern state of Jordan was created out of whole cloth by Great Britain using 75% of the &#39;mandate for Palestine&#39;.<br><br>The &#39;mandate for Palestine&#39; was split into two. One became &#39;Jordan&#39;, the other became &#39;Palestine&#39;.<br><br>&#39;Palestine&#39; was split into two. One part became &#39;Israel&#39;, one part became &#39;Palestine&#39;.<br><br>See the pattern yet?
It appears to have the same source as many conflicts. The well armed conquerors of the land make descisions that seriously affect the cimmon man without taking the commoners needs (the majority) into considerstion. Conflict and choas ensues.
Looking at the territory managed by Egypt and and yet ruled by Iran imams , and what has become of it. And now looking at the land managed by Jews , <br>and makes you see literally what it means to have proper leadership and unity of people.
The dirtiest of all British moves was how they intervened to save the Egypt army from being surrounded and wiped by the IDF and by threading Israel with invasion if Israel didn’t stop its operation.
This program is a travesty. Land alloted them NOT!<br> UN plan was just one of many plans it was a recommendation it had no force of law there was NO legal palestinian territory.The birders of israel were set as all others eg jordan iraq syria by posidetis juris Jordan illegally occupied Samaria and judea .
The world should not forget 6million jews murdered
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjtQ4Jmxh_8&amp;t=860">14:20</a> the 260,000 number of Jews immigrated from Arab states is incorrect, over 850,000 were Expelled as thr Arab League gave notice that Jews in Arab and Muslim countries were to be considered as citizens of the new state of Israel, their businesses were boycotted, they were fired from government jobs, their citizenship revoked, their men and women arrested as Israeli spies, they fled to Israel with only the clothes on their backs. They had property equal to 4 times the lsndmass of Israel confiscated by the Arab states, and are owed over $160 billion in property stolen from them.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjtQ4Jmxh_8&amp;t=750">12:30</a>  the information on Plan Dalet is false, Dalet is the 4th letter of the Hebrew alephbet and was the 4th plan of intelligence gathering by the young Israeli state. It was not implemented, as it was information, not actions.
Lets go to 200 years before that.
You ignore the mandate included Jordan and Syria. Those were the countries given to the Arabs. Lebanon was for the Christians and Isreal for the Jews. All that land was called Palestine and everyone in it could be referred to as Palestinians. The United States of America just took in five million refugees of all different religions and ethnic identities. The Arabs of Jordan and Syria can absorb a couple million refugees that speak the same language and are of the same religion. Isreal is for the Jews.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjtQ4Jmxh_8&amp;t=289">4:49</a> you stated, that many Palestinian Arabs took up the Allies cause in WW2? They stood behind Hajj Amin al Hussaini and backed Hitler, please supply proof of them supporting the Allies??
So the British area in the ME was given to Hussain as promised via Iraq and Jordan - whilst initially the remaining mandate was to be for the Jews. <br>And when the British limited migration to the area now understood to be Israel and the Occupied territories it was basically a stab in the back. It would seem from this that the Arabs in the region have no right of ownership only of residency?
The video states that the White Paper of 1939 (issued in May 1939) was issued a mere 30 minutes before the death of Herr von Rath, the German diplomat in Paris whose murder, shot on 7th November 1938 dying 2 days later, was the pretext for Kristallnacht. It is difficult to reconcile the fact that Kristallnach was on 9th and 10th November 1938 with the White Paper of 1939 having been issued before the murder of 9th November 1938 which was the pretext for Kristallnacht given the chronology outlined above. Or TLDR: The Imperial War Museum is totally wrong about a chronology and cause and effect.
What about the Zionist group&#39;s interest in supporting Nazi Germany against the British. Plus their terrorist bombing campaign against British politicians within the UK?
Not once did you mention arab oil money
No disrespect but the Jewish people do have a receipt for Israel it&#39;s size and the shape it&#39;s in the old testament
Palestinian is in the Middle East for Arabic Muslims, Jews, Christians, atheists &amp; Polytheism. They’ve been living peacefully together for thousands of years, before the Invasion of Zionist colonists.
It is not a conflict it is an &quot;ccupation and *partheidstate.
Honest question- Has anyone ever seen anything like the hate the Israeli Zionists have in them?<br>How can a people and a state have sooo much vicious brutality in them?<br><br>What kind of monstrosity was unleashed in 1948 when this despicable, illegitimate state was created…? <br>Just look at what they’ve done to little children, to churches and hospitals, to journalists, to a whole people.<br>They have surpassed the Nazis in every inhumane way they can. Any person or organisation standing by them is not only immoral, they’re actively destroying the human based values we live by in the free world.
It was arabs land and still is. It didnt belong to the British or UN to give to anyone else
there was never a palestinian nation - the name been given to the land. during that time jews, muslims, christians druze and others lived here.
Where did the newly formed Israel get its arms?
Wait a minute it was the Jewish people in Palestine that started the irgun which committed terror against the British Menachem begin was a terrorist and then a prime minister of Israel.
when you build a freeways that only Jews can use it’s apartheid when keep evacuating Palestinians from their homes to give to some one from Poland or Russia or Brooklyn it’s apartheid when a pregnant women die bcz the cheque point and can’t reach a hospital it’s apartheid when kids can’t make to school bcz of walls in their villages it’s apartheid I can go on and on on on .stop your stupidity 🤮
Thank you for let us know the true.
Almost the whole Palestine Land was occupied by terrorist Israel....
No, the conflict began already 1921 when the British split the Mandate in favor for the Arabs and Muslims, they called it Jordan, because at that time no Arab/Muslim would call himself with the none arabic name Palestinian! With Jordanians attack war and occupation of Judea and Samaria 1948 with the removing of all Jews (killing all who could not flee) in this area and calling it Westbank sharpened the conflict!! All Arabs and Muslims came during the different arabic/muslim IInvader times, but most came during the British Mandate and Jordanians occupation time. <br>Peace will come just when the Arabs/Muslims understand that they are invaders and sit on the land of the Nation of Israel.
Many  that remained in darkness and think that the land belong to Israel, learn to know the reality
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Moral of the story... it&#39;s all Britain&#39;s fault
&quot;On the last day of the Mandate, the Chief Secretary of the British Administration called a press conference in his Jerusalem office. One of the journalists there asked: &quot;And to whom do you intend to give the keys to your office?&quot;. &quot;I shall leave them under the mat&quot;, was the reply.&quot;<br><br>That was Sir Henry Gurney, his Mandate era diary (published and commented by an Israeli historian Motti Golani) makes a good read for anyone interested in the conflict beyond the headlines.
Ironic that the prospect for Palestinian statehood emerged as a result of Israel&#39;s Six-Day War and its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip but not before that when these territories were under Arab control by Jordan and Egypt respectively.
The Palestinian people are among the strongest and bravest on earth. End the occupation, end the humiliation. 🇵🇸
Zionism has made sure that Israelis are never safe as the people they pretend never existed ( a land without a people) do exist. Zionism requires a &quot;final solution&quot; for Palestinians. <br>Zionists didn&#39;t colonize Palestine with the intention of becoming part of the community that already existed there. They came to displace and exclude the people of Palestine from their homes and land physically and politically. Its really no surprise that this hasn&#39;t worked out well for anyone, is it?<br>If zionists had been inclusive instead there would be a very different situation now.<br>Continuing the apartheid, Continuing the genocide will not result in a sustainable future for Israel.
Did you see that the Jewish resistance before the establishment of Israel was against military installations and not against civilians? . On the other hand, the Palestinians now……
People forget that israel in 1900 was almost empty. Half million people lived there barely
Had the chosen the borders differently and not annex Jerusalem there wouldn&#39;t have been such a big mess. So it&#39;s all sides&#39; fault. Jews wanted a stepping stone to expanding the boarders, Arabs sensed it, but at the same time they refused to compromise. Arab nations helped them first but then they made peace with Israel, while Palestinian resistance /terror hasn&#39;t ended since. So 3 sides of intelligent adults should have gotten vetter results.
Palestinians started this war I am telling this as an unbiased Turkish. Because of Iranian government they became radicalized and didn&#39;t end violence as well.
Enjoyed this and would like to see a part 3 maybe even part 4/5.
And this is the explanation about why there can&#39;t be a peaceful solution to this conflict. The UN two states solution has been botched by both parts, and although the original one state ideal in which both Arabs and Jews could live together in peace would be the ultimate solution, this will never happen.
I applaud IWM for exploring this topic. <br>at this time. <br>however. <br>the word &quot;imperial&quot; in the title of the institution does not instil, <br><br>in me, at least, the sense that it is a fair summary. <br>the machinations of the British imperial élite in the Near East made conflict inevitable. <br>it is striking that almost everywhere the empire upped and left, <br>usually in the lurch, was subsequently consumed by violence.
When britain received the mandate over the region palestina included jordan. Britain divided palestina in two and gave the eastern part to the Hashemite family from Saudi arabia in exchange for their help in first world war. before that during the ottoman rule the entire region was called syria palestina. Britain and france divided the territory between them in a secret agreement  called sais picot agreement  frane received syria and lebanon and britain received palestina that includes today jordan. The arab were angry because they want big arab state, big syria. there for the agreement between Faisal and weizmann from 1921 was faild.
Bringing up the Sergeants Affair and ignoring the context can&#39;t be chalked up to YouTube time/attention limits or summarizing.   <br><br>I get the agenda here is to try and be &quot;balanced&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot;, and it&#39;s not a bad job at that. <br><br>....but a lot of the actions of the American colonists in America prior to the Revolutionary War, are no different than the Sergeant&#39;s Affair in pre-state Israel.  <br><br>The Brits had multiple Jews ready to hang, the Jewish extremists took some Brits as hostages to trade.   The Brits didn&#39;t take the offer, and paid for it. Wether you agree, support, condemn, or reject - you have to bring in the context.  Can&#39;t summarize and ignore context.  It WAS an extremist action. It WAS wrong.  But the event had context.
Sound - particularly in terms of the neighbouring Arab states, willing to use the Palestinian Arabs as a cause but not wanting them as a people.<br>The same situation applies today.<br>UK has no influence on this issue now - protests in London and squabbling in the House of Commons just comes over as self-regarding politics.
Jews could have found a home anywhere in the world but they went and destroyed Palestine
As usual, the British are liars here too.<br><br>The Arab al-Husseini was not just a Nazi sympathizer but a close confidant and advisor to Der Fuehrer. It&#39;s said that he counseled Hitler on the &quot;Jewish Problem&quot; by suggesting the Germans demand that the Jews wear a yellow star in public—a practice implemented by Arab Muslim rulers on Jewish second-class citizens in the Arab world.
Thank you for the explanation
My God what a convoluted mess it is - really glad IWM is doing this and shedding some light on it for people like me - non-historians who still want to understand it all.
Why dont they rename everything Caanan again ? <br><br>Merge them all in one. It predates 80yr kingdom of judah anyways
In 1936 the Palestinians were revolting. They still are.
We welcome you as a guest then you kick us from our own homeland.
Historical note: the hanging of the sergeants was a response to the Brits hanging members of Irgun in Acre prison.
An excellent report showing once again that in terms of International Relations; treaties, agreements, contracts, papers, are not worth the paper they are printed on. Except as documents to be later in historical stories, but only for a record of what was written down at the time.<br><br>No Empire is built by being nice, honest, or fair. All Empires are built by taking from those who can not defend themselves.
Here&#39;s a short history lesson about the Arab/Muslim-Israeli/Jewish conflict.<br>The 7th century is the time when the Arabs began to expand their Lebensraum and colonize the world.<br><br>634–38 CE:<br>The Arabs and Muslims invaded and colonized the land, which later became Mandatory Palestine. They not only colonized the future territory of Mandatory Palestine but also millions of square kilometers of land that belonged to other cultures. They gradually Arabized and Islamized the conquered populations.<br> <br>The Arabs and Muslims ruled over that region until 1918.<br> <br>During this period, Jews and Christians had dhimmi status. Dhimmis were second- or even third-class citizens with limited rights. Dhimmis had to pay a special tax (Jizya) for their protection. It is similar to what mobsters ask their victims, like small shop owners, to protect them from unexpected accidents and deaths. (So, no, they did not live in harmony or peaceful coexistence.)<br> <br>A geographical entity called Palestine did not exist during the period of Arab and Muslim rule (634-1918).<br> <br>There were plenty of signs, incl. statements, made by Arab leaders shortly after WWI and up until the 47 UN partition proposal, where Arabs declared that if the effort to establish a Jewish majority state continues, it will end in unrest and wars.<br> <br>Part of the territory of the British Mandate for Palestine (do not confuse it with Mandatory Palestine) was the territory of modern-day Jordan.<br> <br>In 1922, the British gave the Arabs 75% of the British Mandate for Palestine. (Hint: the modern-day Jordan)<br> <br>On July 24, 1922, the League of Nations issued a formal recognition of the Jewish nation&#39;s connection to the Land of Israel and approved the decision to establish a Jewish national homeland in the territory of Mandatory Palestine.<br> <br>In 1937–38, the British offered them 83% of the rest of the British Mandate for Palestine, which became officially known as Mandatory Palestine. All together, if the Arabs hadn’t refused the 37–38 proposals, they could have ended up with c. 96% of British Palestine under their control.<br> <br>In 1947, the UN proposed a plan for the partition of Mandatory Palestine into an Arab-majority state and a Jewish-majority state. The Arabs rejected it.<br> <br>Side note: The boundaries presented in this partition proposal never became official.<br> <br>May 1948:<br>According to the principle of international law known as Uti Possidetis Juris, the whole territory of Mandatory Palestine became Israel at the moment of the declaration of independence in May 1948. (In other words, Israel is not an occupying power.)<br> <br>The Arabs invaded Israel’s territory almost immediately after the declaration of Israel&#39;s independence because they wanted to erase it from the map.<br> <br>Israelis failed to fully liberate their territory from the invading armies, so Judea-Samaria and the territory that later became known as the Gaza Strip remained under illegal Jordanian and Egyptian occupation until 1967.<br> <br>Side note: between 1948 and 1967, the Arabs expressed zero intention to establish an Arab majority state called Palestine in Judea-Samaria and the Gaza Strip. (e.g., see the Article 24 of the PLO Charter from 1964)<br> <br>Side note: The Arabs of that time didn&#39;t self-identify as &quot;Palestinians.&quot;<br> <br>Side note: The so-called Palestinian ethnicity and the myth about the stolen Arab land of Palestine were invented by a handful of Arab leaders with some help from the USSR during the early 1960s. In other words, there&#39;s no scientific or historical evidence that supports this myth. For example, there&#39;s no archeological evidence that an ethnic group called Palestinians or a geopolitical entity (e.g., kingdom or state) with the name Palestine existed before the invention of this myth in the 1960s.<br> <br>In the 1948 war, Israel acquired c. 6480 km2 of land allocated for the Arab state in the UN&#39;s partition proposal. Neither the UN nor other organizations label those territories as occupied.<br> <br>Side note: The 1949 armistice lines (aka &quot;the 1967 lines,&quot; aka &quot;the Green Line&quot;) were neither political nor territorial boundaries (aka official borders between Israel and its neighbors).<br> <br>Yes, some Arabs were expelled, while others left because their leaders promised them that after they crushed the Jews and their state, the Arabs could return.<br> <br>After the Arab defeat in the 1948 war, the Arabs expelled almost 100% of Jews (c.850k) from Arab controlled territories (e.g., North Africa and Judea-Samaria).<br> <br>Between 1949 and the early 2000s, Israel offered the chance to return to over 100k Arab refugees multiple times (e.g., during the 1949 Lausanne Conference). The Arabs rejected those offers.<br> <br>In 1967, during the Six-Day war Israel legally captured territories from the Arabs.<br> <br>Now,<br>Take a look at the logos of Fatah and Hamas.<br> <br>Both of them show the silhouette map of &quot;Palestine&quot; (which they want to liberate). It is quite odd that it resembles the silhouette map of Mandatory Palestine. In other words, both Fatah and Hamas would love to erase Israel from the map and replace it with an Arab and Muslim majority state.<br> <br>As I said before, the Arabs had many opportunities for establishing an Arab state called Palestine. Instead of focusing their efforts to hinder the Jews from establishing and maintaining the only Jewish-majority state, the Arabs could have turned that energy into creating a peaceful Arab state, something like Singapore 2.0.<br> <br>Conclusion:<br> <br>The Arab/Muslim-Israeli/Jewish conflict exists because the Arab/Muslim ego cannot accept the reality that they lost to Jews (their former Dhimmis) a tiny piece (c.0.22%) of their colonized territories.<br> <br>The Arabs and Muslims rejected even the idea of an independent Jewish majority state.<br> <br>Between 1937 and the first two decades of the 2000s, the Arabs and Muslims rejected every offer to establish an independent Arab state called, e.g., &quot;Palestine.&quot; (Here&#39;s an example: Check out the YouTube video with the title &quot;Olmert offered Abbas 20 <a href="http://sq.km/">sq.km</a> more than size of West Bank, according to PLO Chief Negotiator.&quot;)<br> <br>In other words, the goal of the Jews is to have a state, while the goal of the Arabs is not to allow the existence of that Jewish state.<br> <br>Historical facts prove that the only ones that make the lives of the Arab people miserable are those (e.g., Arab leaders, Arab states, the EU and its members, the UN, and various NGOs that made a lucrative business model out of it) who perpetuate this conflict, those (e.g., UNRWA) who teach hatred towards Israel and Jews to Arab people, not Israel. Again, the Arabs could have built a Singapore 2.0 if they truly wanted a better life.<br> <br>Fun fact:<br>According to an Arab (pcpsr dot org) survey from 2022, 51% of Arabs in Arab-controlled territories in Judea and Samaria and in the Gaza Strip (61% Gazans) want to wage war with Israel, while 21% support negotiations.<br> <br>(Text by @t77szilagyi, 2023)
Um, no... The Israel-&#39;palestine Conflict began ~1400 years ago. Your displayed map graphics are DISHONEST btw. &#39;palestine&#39; was a mandate, never a country, also.. when you say that word, strangely you show a red area only covering modern day Israel... In reality the geopolitical area called Mandatory &#39;palestine&#39; covered all of modern day JORDAN as well. The truth is, the Hebrew ancestors of today&#39;s Jews built Jerusalem with their own hands not tens, not hundreds, but <b>THOUSANDS of Years</b> before Islam was invented in a cave. Indeed when the Romans took their turn stealing the Jewish land (then called <b>Judea &amp; Samaria</b> ) and had their turn squatting in it.. they REnamed the entire greater area <i>&quot;Syria Palaestina&quot;</i> solely to remove/hide the Jewish identity and connection to their own land. So here we are today, the indigenous population of that land have it back, they share with anyone who doesn&#39;t want to kill them. The colonial, conquers, SQUATTERS&#39; name of &#39;palestine&#39; has been scrubbed.. the fallacious and pervasive concept of the &#39;palestinian&#39; as a national identity persists. It is possibly the most ingenious, and insidious, deception Islam has ever invented, c1967. They can pretend that there was once a great nation called &#39;palestine&#39; with a rich history dating back to the Cretaceous Period if they like, but anyone with an IQ above room temperature knows better. None of your/their sophistry or ridiculous history-revision will stand in the face of facts.•• They stood aside in 1948 while the massive arab armies promised to &#39;kill all the Jews and drive them into the sea&#39; .. and then THEY LOST. They didn&#39;t get to come back. These arabs and their supporters call it a &#39;Nakhba&#39;.. a &#39;catastrophe&#39;.. which is really rich. Every year we say loudly: &quot;No.. we will not help you mourn <i>the day you FAILED to kill us all</i> &quot;.  Legit, these people mourn that they <b>failed</b> to commit brutal genocide.. that is their &#39;catastrophe&#39; 😂. Funny thing about war is if you try to commit genocide, and YOU LOSE you can lose land - if you fight a war as the aggressor and YOU LOSE, it can be inconvenient for you. Just ask Germany about that huh. This entire population has been lied to by UNRWA that they shouldn&#39;t settle, that they shouldn&#39;t make a better life for themselves, that if they just give birth to enough offspring, and teach them to hate, and to obsess over nothing but slaughtering Jews.. that eventually <i>one day they might &#39;win&#39; the 1948 War of Independence&#39;</i> .. for real, they can&#39;t wrap their head around the fact that they lost 70 years ago. They are so butthurt about losing all wars they star since then that they just keep trying again and again expecting different results. Meanwhile Israel is doing what it does best: inventing stuff. Exporting life-saving medical technology. Creating startups that solve problems. Terraforming the desert. Excelling in arts and science, amongst other things... There is a reason why the emblems of all these &#39;palestinian&#39; groups have AK47s and swords and knives on them.. and the emblem of Israel has 2 olive branches. But also Thank G-d for the Hagana and the IDF. - Am Israel Chai 👌🏽 🇮🇱
imagine all of your neighbors stole everything you own and tried to exterminate all of your People. no one in their right mind would want to go back to living next to those who did all that to them
Oh at  last ,Zionism and terrorism  talked about.....many people seemed to forget this
I commend this channel for telling the truth and not being racist towards Jews
Europe should have given the Europeans Jews a state since they lived in Europe… or simply accepted them in their native countries after the war
It&#39;s been tragedy heaped upon tragedy for both countries and the people living there.<br><br>With brute force and terrible reprisals and apathy for the other side, one side has been able to partly forget about this. <br><br>Until recently anyway..
We, the British, should have had nothing to do with Palestine. A huge mistake, like others there after
I very much enjoyed your video and I gave it a Thumbs Up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjtQ4Jmxh_8&amp;t=27">0:27</a> just watch the beginning of this video and understand how the whole conflict began, and then understand that the Palestinian people have a right to defend themselves and their land, it’s like the British in Northern Ireland killing more and more people in Northern Ireland and then moving towards the southern areas of Ireland and then they start building settlements in Ireland and continue to build and kill the civilians and control everything from roads and checkpoints to access to food and resources including water? Now imagine that ? Do you think that the Irish people would not fight back against this oppression? And do you think the world would behave like how they are behaving towards the Palestinian people?
it&#39;s wild how Palestinians think that they deserve 3  States but Jews shouldnt even be allowed to have one.. Smh
How many times have a group attacked another to take over a resource, and that has rippled over time and place until it can extend over much of a continent? IMHO, this is a ripple of Hitler, if not before.<br>There&#39;s a whole uninhibited continent available to live in and mine for the resources.
Why were the British there in the first place, and in India, and in Ireland and in China? Causing trouble all over the place.
Seemingly no one wanted israel to exist at their own expense.<br>The jews didn&#39;t even try carve out a state in europe and they were still forced to flee. <br>It&#39;d be pretty naive to think they wouldn&#39;t see similar treatment elsewhere. especially after the legendary zionist paramilitaries carved out the state of Israel, and did so in a rather impressive military conquest.
The British remained in the region long enough for the Jewish population to establish control over the situation, a plan that was formulated as far back as 1917. Their pretense of impartiality was merely a facade. This is indicative of how white supremacists operate.
There are some interesting interpretations of some of the events in this video.  Palestine has never existed as a country, it was a vilayet within the Ottoman empire, the local tribes did not observe borders and did not have a homeland.
In the long history of this land, despite being the birthplace of the major religions, it has known so much bloodshed. <br>Conqured by the Muslims circa 640AD, then by the Christians in the First Crusade in 1099 , (the massacre of Jews and Muslims alike by these &quot;knights&quot;  lacks the chivalry we would normally associate with knights) . <br>I fear this land will never see peace.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(636%E2%80%93637)%C2%A0">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(636%E2%80%93637) </a><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1099)#:~:text=On%2015%20July%201099%2C%20the,Jerusalem%20were%20filled%20with%20blood">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1099)#:~:text=On%2015%20July%201099%2C%20the,Jerusalem%20were%20filled%20with%20blood</a>.
Incorrect in the video there were 850k Jews with a history of over 2000 years who fled and were persecuted in Arab countries not 260k
I&#39;m not picking a side, but it is rather impressive how Isreal started with nothing and 75 years later they are a regional superpower.
Failed to claim an Arab state and defeated the war they started. What else needed to say, 76 years later.
I&#39;m not sure one could truly say Britain &quot;lost&quot; to Israel. I think they more or less just threw their hands up and said to hell with it, y&#39;all deal with it.
Israelis government is committing genicide, and palestinians are at the risk of it according to the U.N. report!
Palestine as a country never existed, so it could not &quot;wiped of the map&quot;.
FANTASTIC Video! Did an amazing job showing how both sides are guilty of terrible acts towards one another and even towards themselves.<br><br>I hope this goes viral so people learn the actual history and not the Anti-Israel or Anti-Palestinian versions we see so often today.
When will Jewish states be established in all other Middle-Eastern and North African regions from where almost all Jews have been expelled and genocided out?
There is so much space on the planet. Why not pick another location for them to settle from the beginning? Like idk, south america, east russia, or whatever. Now both groups share a tiny bit of land and they freaking hate each other. I doubt there will ever be peace. It`s unsolvable at this point.
Thanks for the video. Informative and well presented.<br>Lets hope there will eventually be some semblance of peace in the region, whatever that looks like. At the end of the day it is innocent people who suffer.
The conflict between Jews and Arabs in Israel/Palestine began with a few incidents at the end of the 19th century, but really didn&#39;t kick in until after WWI. So it&#39;s about 100 years old. It does not stretch back into the mists of antiquity -- please spare us those ridiculous phrases. The Arabs/Muslims didn&#39;t step out of Arabia until the 600s AD. The Jews/Israelites ruled Israel for about 1000 years until 70 AD. Israel was under foreign occupation until 1948, but there were always Jews there, though the majority lived in the Diaspora after 70 AD.
Omitting the fact that the Arab leaders told Arabs in Palestine to leave their homes ahead of the fighting is incredibly misleading. The blame for their flight is placed solely on Jews in this summary and is inappropriate, especially when using terms like Nakba without explaining the meaning behind the Arab term (setback of their goal total control of the land by Arabs).
You keep calling it Palestine. Please could you inform me exactly when ‘Palestine’ has been an independent, sovereign nation? As far as I know, an independent Palestine has never existed, whereas Israel has a long history of existing.
A decent attempt at being impartial, factual and informative. This is a really interesting summary into the Arab-Israeli issues in the modern era. Anyone watching just needs to keep in mind that this has been going on for much longer than 2,000 years. All of this has happened before, and all of it will happen again.
“I shall leave them under the mat”<br><br>What a classic line. Imagine someone saying something like that in a press conference in 2024!!!
Thanks for putting your archive resources into manageable format for non-historians like myself, for citizens in a democracy need to know something of the past in order to lobby representatives for a just solution to present problems.
Is a two-state solution possible between Israel and Palestine? <br>Comment below and join the conversation.
Nakupenda baibe
Thanks for the big lesson 🙏
So British should be blamed once again? they’re the villains in most stories of the world
We Hindus have always supported Jews. If required we must extend military support too🎉
New Lands Journeys ----- The Real Peace forwarded by Osmaniyyah !!! Leave Ancient Ar Civilisation!!! <br>Athenos Latinium Latinim Byzantine never wanted peace !!!

Thank you 🙏
In Bible the. Jewish don&#39;t accept and believe in Jesus Christ <br>Jews are always against Jesus Christ they crucified Jesus without any reason so that&#39;s why till today they haven&#39;t find peace in this world 🙏
Muslims are turning the tables in america &amp; GB with Muslim religion &amp; our laws.
It really sounds to me like The Palestinians have been the problem from the beginning. They just hate Jews and cannot tolerate the idea of a Jewish state next to them. They want everything and that’s that. Israel seems to be more than willing to compromise. At this point I say F Palestine and Israel needs to take over the entire country. Is what it is.<br>     FAFO
Insha Allah Palestine will be free.. Amen
Exactly ancient time, don&#39;t say it exists
Nice one
Best explanation

Pilki mam, you are awesome reporter and lecturer. Very clear and entertaining. Thanks mam and God bless you.
Aren&#39;t you ashamed to fabricate it in this complete false manner....
The Jews believe it is their original homeland and the Palestinians want pre - 1967 borders...Only God can bring peace.
During the otrule, the entire area that is now syria, jordan and israel was called syria palestina. there were no borders. When the first jewish settlement began in 1882, the population was sparse and most arabs lived in villages. The jews setlers settled in places that were not inhabited or in places they bought from landowners. The living conditions of the first settlers were very difficult,  they had to drain swamps, there were many diseases such as malaria. There were also settlers who could not live in such conditions and returned to Russia. The fate of the settlers who returned back to Russia was bad and they were murdered.
Thanks Pilki. Your report is wonderful light shining in the darkest corners of the history of state of Israel and Palestine. Bravo.
A full comprehensive and unbiased analysis. Thank you so much, I will come back here as a reference.
It started when Abraham had a son with Hagar while he and Sarai should have been waiting on the God of Israël.<br>The next son which is the promised son, is Isaac.<br><br>Ismaël (Arabs) and Isaac (Israël)were fighting.<br><br>The Palestines are the Filistines from the bible and descendants of Ismaël.<br>The Israelites are descendants of Isaac.<br><br>Israël is the promised land for the descendants of Isaac and Yeshua came for the Jew first but now also non Jews can be added to the vine through the sacrifice of Yeshua.<br><br>When Gods people from the line of Isaäc and Jacob came back to the promised land it was a desert and they worked and changed the land and now it looks beautiful again.<br><br>The name Palestine was given by the united kingdom but it was never the land for the filistines but promised to the house of Jacob, descendants of Isaac, by the God of Israël.
Am i the only one who saw mark Zuckerberg dressed in uniform with glasses in this vidoe?
People need to know that in Israel all the signs are also in Arabic. We have Arabic doctores and proffesors, lecturers in univer.., and many Arab judges, even in the supreme court....
she forgot to mention, after the romans kicked the Jews out they renamed the Land of Israel to syria palestina. And that&#39;s how the forever Israel became fake palestine.
This video shows hamas are the resistance
U did not mention the Jews in the Arab world... There were more than a few thousand Jews in West Asia, N. Africa.
Goliath vs David Godless to God&#39;s Children
I love history.
The entire land is Israel, the homeland of Israeli jews since 3000 BC for 45 centuries, <br><br>Israel existed sinceb3000 BC.  But Israel was invaded by successive world empires ( The last of which is the muslim Ottoman empire) ,  and most of the Israeli  jews were driven out from their homeland. <br><br>They returned to their homeland in 1947-48.
This is why I respect First post news and documentaries well researched.
Well articulated,im now satisfied with what i hear,Thanks
The madman hitler created the problem of Israel and Palestine
So it basically means that jews want palestine no matter what the issue is they will use politics or force to occupy and if the palestinian try to defend they&#39;ll use both power to manipulate &amp; still nobody has the idea💡 to solve it!! Right!!
The Bible said that God will bring the Israelites back to their homeland and He did bring them back.
listen thiers a reason you are a journalist and not a historian first palestine was the fourth place chosen becuase zionism and jeduaism do not mix  zionist are athiest so to say palestine was promised to jews by God is a lie so athiest bealieve in God when it suits them second israelites where dark skined hebrews your history lesson is full of shit 10s of thousands of people  thiers more palestinians then jews by 3x
I would also like to point out a couple of things.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR-embMmMQc&amp;t=120">2:00</a> - It&#39;s not that important, but the Jews called themselves &quot;Israeli&quot; not &quot;Israelite&quot;. &quot;Israelite&quot; is used in English Bible translations. The term that Jews used to describe themselves was &quot;Israeli&quot; and for other people groups in their era, for example, &quot;Canaani&quot; (written as &quot;Canaanites&quot; in the English translation of the Bible). &quot;Ites&quot; is an English way of describing Biblical people groups. There are no &quot;ites&quot; in Hebrew. <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR-embMmMQc&amp;t=316">5:16</a> - So many facts and details are left out of Israel-Palestine conflict. Sorry but it&#39;s sketchy and shallow.<br><br>First, the land that was called &quot;Palestine&quot;, now Israel, had scant and stagnant Arab Bedouin population from the time between the middle-age crusades and 19th century, which grew from 200,000 to only 300,000 during this period, because of harsh living conditions there. The land was nothing but a wasteland with large areas of marshy swamp. <br><br>And much of the land was owned by rich nobles who did not live there but lived abroad in prosperous regions of the Ottoman empire.<br><br>When they started selling the land to the Jews, those were the worst pieces of their lands, and that too at exorbitant prices (as compared to rest of the world at that time, even if compared to then-land prices in Europe &amp; America). But, the Jews, with their hard work and commitment to settle in their ancient land, converted the vast marshy wastelands into groves. <br><br>After the development started to kick in the area, it witnessed mass migration from the surrounding Arab regions - people who came in search for better living standards. But, just as today the big cities get populated in slums because there are not that many jobs for all the people migrating, there was a problem of excess of labour, which increased the misery of those migrating from the surrounding Arab countries. <br><br>If this caused the Israeli-Palestinian problem, then that should apply to other regions in the world too. For example, between the Blacks &amp; the White Americans (though the situation between Israelis &amp; Palestinians was never half that bad). But the Blacks never vowed to annihilate the Whites nor issued violent &#39;intifada-kind of violence&#39; against them. For example, where can one find this as a part of Black freedom slogan: &quot;to kill every White till none remains&quot;? But, this has been the Palestinian militant attitude towards the Jews since the early 1900s and since before and before. <br><br>There is a long and continuing history of fatally-violent statements by the Arab leaders against the Jews (amounting to genocide). Does the media ever bring this to notice that their main leaders were publicly-open friends of Hitler? This could all be found easily in the news archives and history accounts, ironically not in a very distant history.<br><br>So, there was a religious angle to it all as well. There were Jewish and Arab settlements side by side, and scores of Jewish settlements were rampaged by the Arab militant factions and the massacres of the Jews was not uncommon since the early 1900&#39;s. This also led the Jews to maintain their own private militias.<br><br>The Peel Commission in 1937 offered a partition plan which gave Jews about 20% of the land, but the Arab leaders rejected it. Then the 1948 mandated partition split the land about equally to both the Jews and the Arabs, but again the Arabs rejected it. <br><br>They had always been rejecting a side-by-side existence with Israel and kept refusing the 2-state solution, until very recently when it&#39;s too late.
Can you do a story on Fall of the Soviet Union &amp; the aftermath? I know all of that is already available, but it is such a joy to hear from you which even your critics (if there is) would be in concurrence, and such topics if covered from you would ensure unbiased research rather than one-sided story of such events in the past.
I have no words left. Wonderfully explained.
Thank you Palki...you have so much patience...😊
Journalists nowadays believe they are walking and breathing encyclopedias, and that they are entitled to educate us on everything from history to  religion, to science, to nitrition, medicine, so on and so forth.<br>Now that every other Indian has become a historian all of a sudden this is direly needed.<br>Norman Finkelstein, Jewish American political scientist who chose the TRUTH.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZGPZRkqJzY">https://youtu.be/mZGPZRkqJzY?si=54Ugy2HudXXr3tIl0</a>
Nice 👍
looks like the land of palestinian were taken away from them while they were sleeping. and the same poeple that were chasing and killing the jew are the same people orchestrated this whole ward. not becasue they wanted to help jew but because of their own interest. europeans government are just the devils in human form.

Come on palki one would expect better journalism from u but sadly u muddled up history.
Wowww I love that fiction story.❤️ Keep up the hard work. Considering that we’ve seen thousands of ppl leaving their houses and farms  by force. I really really wonder why India is taking the Israeli side🤔🤔. Thanks again for the lovely explanation specially with all TRUE EVIDENCE you  gave us😂. Thanks for internet we actually can see the other side of the story 🙃
The Final TRUTH is That ...YESHUA saved my Soul.....Let those Who are without sin...cast the stones....Blessed are the Peace Makers...,,,the antichrist will make a peace treaty for 7 days..1 week, and in the middle of the week Break the treaty and make an abomination of Daily Sacrifices for ISREAL...making blasphemies against ADONAI....GOD THE FATHER...YESHUA....LORD of Heaven and Earth.......YESHUA will come in GLORY to destroy satan , fallen angels, and those who reject YESHUA and those who take the mark of the beast..666.... and the righteous will shine like Glorious LIGHTS of YAWHEY....JOHN.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR-embMmMQc&amp;t=196">3:16</a>...Salvation in JESUS...<br>don&#39;t hate ME for the TRUTH..rather repent before The Great and Awesome as well as Horrible Day Of The LORD YESHUA IN HIS GLORY....REPENT, CONFESS YESHUA....CONFESS JESUS......JESUS HEALED ME OF YEARS OF CANCER, Gave me a good job, casted out demons, heals the sick raises the dead....MUST HAVE FAITH. LOVE LOVE LOVE...TRINITY ELOIHIM YESHUA HOLY SPIRIT with all your heart soul mind might and LOVE Your Neighbor as Yourself!!! AMEN...!
Where is the freakin International Laws? Why the Israelis keep stealing more land from these people? Palestinians have the right to live their lives peacefully. Settlers= Terrorists.
PURE GOLDDDDDDDD
Bro... Ottoma  literally accept jews it is Babylonian and roman whom exiled jews. And European Christian before Holocaust and when Holocaust that persecuting jews. And yet they hate arab and muslim and be friends with European Christian
Great Information! Thank you🙏
Great explanation of the situation
Thank you so much ma&#39;am ❤
Why is the question, that the Jews were persecuted in Germany, look at the Rothschild family they were rich and had great political ties with Britain. There&#39;s a two prong view with this staged plot.
So you mean we all near to world end Judgment day is soon
Israel was created country ok thanks
Sounds like EU and US need to leave the middle East and let them sort it out. <br>Im tired of funding these forever wars.
Sorry for my questions I want to know the <a href="http://truth.my/">truth.My</a> questions is If all the Land of MIDDLE EAST is a DESSERT so How the manna fall on top of the sand ? second question Why the bible say the dew on the grass ?
The thing is I have strange dreams and terrifying .
Shalom  Lady I have a question for you .when Abraham was still in this world when he left his father&#39;s house going to the Land of Canaan, did he cross the Red sea ? Second question is from Bethel to Egypt did he cross red sea ? . Please I need answers please please 🙏🙏🙏
Israe is the right side , they owned this land way before muslims came and also jewish and arabs live in peace in israel thats the palestines that make the problem
History as it is...
Her accent is a real turn off.
You&#39;re not only a news anchor but a special teacher who teaches more than many professional teachers do through news presentations. You&#39;re unique and the best
...and lastly and of utmost importance, the Palestinians do not want a State based on the 1967 borders, they have been crystal clear, that they want only a single Arab state from the river to the sea and from Lebanon down to Egypt!!
You have provided a very unbiased and clear presentation of the history. I would just add one very important clarification. You imply that the Europeans were to blame for Jewish discrimination - and that is absolutely true. But we must emphasise that a massive number of Jews were dispelled em masse from many Arab states leading up to and following 1948.
Thank you for telling the truth
Palka sharma is really good with words and broadcaster. But you still can&#39;t beat ace.
&quot;Muslims never presecuted Jews&quot; Christians commited atrocities on Jews becoz Jews murdered Jesus.
The jews returned to the land which is promised for their end. In simple word the geginning of the end has started for jews. U people study quran to know real history of this unthankful and conspirator nation jews. They r dispersed in different parts of the world becoz of their conspiracies and not following the laws set for them in jewish religion. They always forgot the mecies of Allah
As a Palestinian and before I watched it, I thought oh here is another bs video for of lies. However I was so surprised that it wasn’t. Well except for a tiny detail when she said Palestine want what’s theirs and that’s from 1967, no it was 1948. Another important part she missed was. Jews weren’t buying lands, they were refugees with no money, they were given weapons and they just stole everything in sight.<br><br>The reason Israelis agreed to 2 states is because they were getting free land to people without land, and the reason Palestinians rejected is because they would lose more than half (55%) of their land. <br>Do you blame them?
What happened to the Biblican history?  The Lord God gave the land to Israelites.
&quot;If i dont steal your house someone else will.&quot; —Zionist proverb
Flashback :- the so called Jews or Israelites aren&#39;t the true Hebrews of the Bible Palki convincingly bypassed to mentioned. I thought this gives the story a different look &amp; meaning why the Ashkenazi impostors are massacring the real Semantic people
If you really want to get the history out then why not interview people who matter? People like Norman Finkelstein, ilhan pappe, Max Blumenthal, John mersheimer, etc.
The whole world with palastine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Miss Sykes–Picot Agreement - Wikipedia
What a great presentation! Watched it twice to save facts to educate people about the conflict.
Geography is always determined who win the wars. This time may be the end of Gaza.Isreali- Palestinians/Arabs are treated and better off in Israel than those under terrorist groups, as long as they don&#39;t create trouble. In reality Palestinian state is not feasible, it possible to have one multi racial state since we are all one human race.
It&#39;s not Israel Vs Palestine but Hamas
Surprisingly fair analogy from her
False the peel partition was rejected by zionist and palestinians ofer to  live with them and give them rights! So dont bent reality lady! Facts are wtiten in history already, also the partition plan was basicaly the divizion of palestinians with 3 other conties having autority over them...if someone do that tl my county i would not accept either... so isnot palesinian foult... also you refuse to tell that the zionist  movement refuse to negociate with the palestinians and only ask  brithish   what they want....😅 totaly fair! Partition plan not accepted by both state and they still dont care and refuse further negociation... and of course lets take more land then as they were better prepared
So, this is the same story for all parts of the world,  America displaced native Americans,  Africans, Indians,  imagine if these people were allowed to get their land back...because GOD was a realestate agent...and These Jews are terrorists
This seems to be a one sided description of what occurred.  Those paramilitary groups of Israel’s attacked Palestinian towns and forcibly removed the populous.  There is much blame to go on both sides…a 2 state solution seems to be the only way out of constant war.  But that has to be equitable and neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis can be trusted to come up with a fair plan.  The UN must broker a deal and all parties must agree…a compromise that will be painful to some but will also begin the healing process.
The “forgetful” presenter did not say that the Arabs once captured the entire Middle East and northern Africa with Fire and Sword, destroying almost the entire male population of all countries. She “forgot” to tell that after the end of WWII, Britain and France, as the victorious countries, received instructions from the League of Nations to rebuild the defeated Ottoman Empire. Both countries received Mandates from the League. And new countries were created: Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and others. Under the Mandate for Palestine, Britain was supposed to help create a Jewish state on the territory of the former Jewish state.<br>In 136 AD. The Romans expelled the unconquered Jews from their country. They plundered the Temple and... built the Colosseum in Rome. And in the arena of this Colosseum they began to openly demonstrate their morals, against which these rebellious Jews fought. In the Colosseum arena, men had sex with men, and women with various animals, including wild ones. The cannibals chopped and tore each other into pieces, devouring the defeated opponent for the amusement of the spectator. And in order to further humiliate the Israelis, they renamed the country “Palestine,” which in Hebrew is consonant with “plundered.”<br>In WWI, Britain was ready to enter into an alliance even with the devil in order to gain victory. And after the victory, having received the Mandate, she farmed it out to one nomad brother - the bandit Iraq. Other countries had already been formed. Another nomadic brother, a bandit, began to make claims against Britain, recalling to her his past merits. Wanting to pay off, Britain divides Mandatory Palestine into parts and gives 66% to a bandit - a sheikh. This is how “Transjordan” appeared, on the territory of Left Bank Israel. With Hitler&#39;s rise to power, Britain issued a White Paper and, based on “humane considerations,” severely limited Jewish immigration. . At the same time, Britain made great efforts to drive Arabs from different countries to these desert lands.<br>The remaining part of the Mandate was cut into separate unconnected pieces and given to the Jews. These were mainly malarial swamps and waterless deserts.<br>Jews fleeing pogroms and anti-Semitism agreed to such a division. But the Arab League, an ally of Hitler, did not even consider the possibility of providing asylum to Jewish refugees. The Arabs were confident in their strength. They have been acting by force for centuries and destroying everyone in their path.<br>This is how Muslims created the “Beautiful Country” - Pakistan, at the cost of the lives of 60 million Hindus.<br>The Arabs attacked Israel immediately after the announcement of the creation of a new state. In addition to the five surrounding countries, three more countries sent their troops. Leaving Israel, Britain not only took away all the weapons, but also declared an embargo on the supply of both weapons and food to the young country. British officers with WWII and WWII experience led many Arab armies and divisions in the war against Israel. All Arab countries in the region expelled the Jews, most often with a bundle of things in their hands, but sometimes without things. In total, the Arabs expelled about a million Jews. Some went to South. America, Australia, but more than 650,000 were accepted and assimilated by Israel, whose entire population then amounted to 650,000 people. And that&#39;s not the whole story...
The presenter “accidentally forgot” to mention that the very term “Palestinians” was introduced in KGB training camps in 1964 in order to somehow distinguish this group of Arabs from others: Egyptians, Iranians, Iraqis, Pakistanis, Syrians and other “fighters for communism” &quot;. Well, they couldn&#39;t call them Israelis! Soviet anti-Semites simply did not turn their tongues at this. It was in these camps that they were taught to attack and seize embassies, planes, and blow up buses with children. Three years later, five Arab countries with huge armies, armed with hundreds of thousands of pieces of equipment from the same USSR, attacked Israel and the “nickname Palestinians” came in handy.<br>Before this, for 2000 years only Jews were called “Palestinians” and were driven from everywhere “to your Palestine.”
Dear, It’s hard for me to believe that you don’t know the details of the creation of the state of Israel and the illegal formation of “transjordan”. This means that you are well aware that no state of “Palistine” has ever existed, just like the “people of Palestine”. These so-called “people of Palestine” are the descendants of Arab migrant workers who came to Israel from neighboring Arab countries after the start of Jewish immigration at the beginning of the 20th century.<br>    Can you really imagine that the creation of ANOTHER ADDITIONAL new Arab state will change anything? And this is in the presence of 22 Arab and 38 Muslim countries, occupying an area of more than  13 million square  kilometers?! I hope you will agree that this is not a territorial conflict at all, but an existential conflict. <br>   This was openly stated by Mr. Erdogan, who claims leadership in the Islamic world, threatening war with complete destruction of “the Jews, the crusaders and all infidels.”  If you are not Muslim, then you are definitely among the infidels who are subject to complete destruction.  I am sure that you are aware of this and understand that this is not a slip of the tongue of an “inexperienced politician.”  It&#39;s time to stop turning a blind eye to the obvious.  <br> <br>                   There is a war of Islam against the WHOLE WORLD.<br>                  Israel simply found itself on the first line of defense !!!<br>             Meet this :   Islam and global jihad - WAR AGAINST ALL MANKIND!<br> <br>Allah has decided to destroy all the infidels and the unclean. And he started with Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah and Iran prepare to accept the wrath of the Almighty ! <br>                                 !لقد قرر الله تدمير جميع الكفار والنجسين. لقد بدأت مع حماس في غزة. حزب الله وإيران يستعدان لقبول غضب الله تعالى!<br> <br>1. Before Israel, there was a British mandate, not a Palestinian state<br>2. Before the British Mandate, there was the Ottoman Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>3. Before the Ottoman Empire, there was the Islamic state of the Mamluks of Egypt, not a Palestinian state.<br>4. Before the Islamic state of the Mamluks of Egypt, there was the Ayubid Arab-Kurdish Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>5. Before the Ayubid Empire, there was the Frankish and Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem, not a Palestinian state.<br>6. Before the Kingdom of Jerusalem, there was the Umayyad and Fatimid empires, not a Palestinian state.<br>7. Before the Umayyad and Fatimid empires, there was the Byzantine empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>8. Before the Byzantine Empire, there were the Sassanids, not a Palestinian state.<br>9. Before the Sassanid Empire, there was the Byzantine Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>10. Before the Byzantine Empire, there was the Roman Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>11. Before the Roman Empire, there was the Hasmonean state, not a Palestinian state.<br>12. Before the Hasmonean state, there was the Seleucid, not a Palestinian state.<br>13. Before the Seleucid empire, there was the empire of Alexander the Great, not a Palestinian state.<br>14. Before the empire of Alexander the Great, there was the Persian empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>15. Before the Persian Empire, there was the Babylonian Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>16. Before the Babylonian Empire, there were the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, not a Palestinian state.<br>17. Before the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, there was the Kingdom of Israel, not a Palestinian state.<br>18. Before the kingdom of Israel, there was the theocracy of the twelve tribes of Israel, not a Palestinian state.<br>19. Before the theocracy of the twelve tribes of Israel, there was an agglomeration of independent Canaanite city-kingdoms, not a Palestinian state.<br>20. Actually, in this piece of land there has been everything, EXCEPT A PALESTINIAN STATE.<br>(Borrowed from a friend)<br>A little more history for those wanting to &#39;restore Palestine&#39;.<br>In 132 AD the Emperor Hadrian resolved to stamp the Jews and their religion out of existence. He sold all Jewish prisoners into slavery after the revolt of Bar Kikhba, forbade the teaching of the Torah, renamed the province Syria Palaestina, and changed Jerusalem’s name to Aelia Capitolina. He renamed Israel to wipe out the national identity of Israel and the Jews.<br>So if you are looking to &#39;restore Palestine to the Palestinians&#39;, you need to give it back to the Jews.
One sided version yet again 😂
Palki Sharma is G.O.A.T
Those converted Ashknazi white European Jews belong in Europe, Palestine was beautiful country before zionst arrive there, Herzl wrote in his diary in 1897 (Jerusalem magnificent city as I imagined, European style, those squatters need to pack and head home
Jews move to Palestine homeland during ww2 not their home.then why  is jews take over arzb land.who is god and why he mess the world up.for me there is no first second people.
I would like to add that during Utman empire Jewish Cristian and Muslim did not have any problem. But British and its alies forces created this blood shed for a political and economical reason which you see now. The free using of Red Sea and Swiss Canal.

THIS IS NOT A WAR OR A CONFLICT ,THIS IS ONE-SIDE SLAUGHTER . DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS LAND BELONGS TO? AS YOU SAID ISRAEL OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN AREAS. WHTA PALESTINE DOES IS DEFENSE .
This reminded me childhood story &quot;THE CAMEL &amp; THE NOBEL MAN&quot;. Once upon a time a man was travelling through the desert along with his camel. It was winter season and nights became very cold in desert. After sunset man decided to take rest and set his camp. Outside camel felt too much cold and requested the man if he can enter his face inside which was accepted. After sometime camel again requested to enter his front legs which was also accepted. But it was not enough for the camel and he entered his rear legs as well. There was not enough space in the camp &amp; the man had to sleep outside in the cold. Israel is&quot;Camel&quot; in this story and the &quot;Nobel Man&quot; is Palestine.

Israel Palestine conflict disclosed the hypocrite face of the western world who were considered themselves as the people of high moral ground
In short, Palestine gave refuge to Jews, but the Jews claimed Palestinian land. Israel is wrong, and the 50 years of history backs this.
Chislam is the root cause of all suffering in the world..

The IDF&#39;s achievements were only against small children, women and the elderly, now they are fighting against walls and pits, which is not worthy of you being called an army😂😂

what is the IDF trying to shoot? EMPTY BUILDING? are there any bodies of Palestinian soldiers? the answer is none. they Israeli soldiers were really frustrated because they felt like they were fighting with ghosts
Oi israel babi hang kenapa duk serang saudara kami palestina hang tu dah lah yahudi pastu hang babi
🇵🇸💥🇮🇱🇺🇸🇬🇧 The true cause of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is oil and gas.<br><br>It all started in 1995, when the Oslo-2 agreement was signed in Washington on 28 September, giving Palestine the right to independently manage its natural resources. On 5 October of the same year, the Israeli parliament ratified the agreement by majority vote.<br><br>Four years later, Palestine concluded a contract with British corporation BG for exploration of the shelf. In 1999, BG hit the jackpot. It turned out that Palestine, 20 miles off the coast, had the richest reserves of natural gas and oil. UN experts estimated the gas reserves at 122 trillion cubic feet and 1.7 billion barrels of oil (old prices $453 billion and $71 billion, now trillions). <br><br>Israel proposed that Palestine supply gas to Israel at an internal price (i.e., not a market price) so that Israel could export the gas to Europe. Palestine, of course, did not agree.<br><br>In 2007, Israel imposed a naval blockade and blocked all development work. On 26 September 2022, the Nord Streams were blown up. In the summer of 2023, meetings began on the issue of rapid development of the field with the mediation of the USA. On 18 June 2023, Benjamin Nitanyahu issued an official statement approving the field development project. <br><br>On 30 October 2023, having secured its military advantage and control over Gaza, Israel issued twelve licences for gas extraction in the very place that, according to Oslo-2, belongs to Palestine. They are mostly British companies getting them, Macron got screwed. <br><br>Israel, the US, and the UK are killing tens of thousands of people in Gaza for a trillion dollars. Therefore, no one will return the northern part of Gaza to the Palestinians. There, as in Libya and Syria, there will be oil and gas infrastructure protected by PMCs. The works are in full swing.<br><br>This means Hamas, Israel, and America conducted the 10/7 together. That&#39;s why part of the troops were taken off the Gaza border. That&#39;s why the Israeli helicopters killed their own civilians (they needed to appear as victims in the eyes of the world). The ordinary Hamas fighters are just being played like a fiddle by its leadership. It&#39;s just another 9/11, an inside job, blamed on Muslims. The UK and Qatar are involved, as well.
Thief never becomes an owner. Free free Palestine
In the midst of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the toll on civilians is profound and deeply troubling. The urgency for a swift and comprehensive peace agreement is paramount. Innocent lives are being lost, families are torn apart, and communities are left in ruins. The international community must exert collective efforts to address the root causes of the conflict, ensuring that both parties commit to an immediate ceasefire and engage in constructive dialogue. Humanitarian aid, including medical assistance and support for displaced families, should be prioritized to alleviate the immediate suffering. Only through sustained diplomatic efforts can we hope to build a foundation for lasting peace, fostering an environment where all communities can coexist and thrive.
So sad😢to see this war Jesus plz stop the war

I don&#39;t believe that there is any religion that permits genocide. If there is one then it is a false religion or the religious man is not as religious as he claims to be. Save Muslims, stop the massacre if you fear God.

Don&#39;t stop Israel
The IDF is fighting children, not Hamas fighters.<br>stop making stupid stories
This war is not between Muslims and Jews, but a war between right and wrong. The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) told about this war 1400 years ago. You can see for yourself. The world has been divided into two parts, one part is false.  The second part is the ruler of the right, the people are right, Israel with the use of modern weapons and with the Palestinian homeless women and children, you are not ashamed, Israel.

Will never forget this man being one of the very first to defend the Palestinians at the earliest days of the conflict. He stood nearly alone as a western leader in defense of Palestinians, their plight, and their resistance. Real man of b@lls.
JoeJenocideBiden
Just very happy to know that the unambiguous truth spoken by Yanis Varoufakis resonates well with me. Much respect to him.
The wéstern peoples care about human rights or about freedom, only care about the wealth the small countries have and stealing from them if you don’t agree with them what they do bomber your country simple as that , this includes the united state as the number one thief .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w53SeU11yqs&amp;t=97">1:37</a>   that is NOT what Terra Nullius means!!  FFS ‼️‼️‼️<br>It means no one OWNS the land!! NOT that there are no people
❤ Vrátiť PALESTÍNE územia ktoré jej Patria <br>Veľká Británia porušila všetky práva PALESTÍNY. Anglosasi s ROTHSCHILDOM nemali žiadne právo na VYTVORENIE ŠTÁTU IZRAEL a preto nesú plnú zodpovednosť za to čo sa tam deje.
I mean anyone with a brain knows that US or Western govt. elites doesn&#39;t care about others human rights or democracy...They care about maintaining influence in a region to control and steal resources....They deceive  their own citizens and others by presenting themselves as heros and savior of the people while implementing their agenda hidden behind spreading democracy...
I personally don&#39;t buy this crap from this dude from Greece...lets talk about facts which I don&#39;t think western media or people talk about.....but i would suggest you all who take money to run the propaganda to de-bunk anyone of these. <br>The History of the imaginary Palestinian state:<br><br>Before Israel there was a British Mandate, not a Palestinian state<br>Before the British Mandate, it was the Ottoman Empire, not a Palestinian state. <br>Before the Ottoman Empire Was the Islamic State of the Mamluks of Egypt, not a Palestinian state. <br>Before the Islamic State of the Mamluks from Egypt, the Arab-Kurdish Empire was the Ayyubid, not a Palestinian state. <br>Before the Ayyubid Empire was the Frankish and Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem, not a Palestinian state.<br>Before the Kingdom of Jerusalem was the Umayyad and Fatimid empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>Before the Umayyad and Fatimid empires, the Byzantine Empire was not a Palestinian state.<br>Before the Byzantine Empire, there were Sassanids, not a Palestinian state. <br>Before the Sassanid Empire was the Byzantine Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br><br>Before the Byzantine Empire was the Roman Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>Before the Roman Empire it was a Hasmonean state, not a Palestinian state. <br>Before the Hasmonean state was the Seleucid, not a Palestinian state. <br>Before the Seleucid Empire was the Empire of Alexander, not a Palestinian state.<br>Before Alexander&#39;s empire it was the Persian Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>Before the Persian Empire was the Babylonian Empire, not a Palestinian state. <br>Before the Babylonian Empire were the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, not a Palestinian state. <br>Before the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, there was no kingdom of Israel in the kingdom of Israel, not a Palestinian state. <br>Before the Kingdom of Israel, the theocracy of the twelve tribes of Israel was not a Palestinian state. <br>Before the theocracy of the twelve tribes of Israel, there was an accumulation of independent Canaanite city-kingdoms, not a Palestinian state.<br><br>In fact, in this plot of land kingdoms fell and fell .. But there was never a Palestinian state or a people.!<br>The Palestinians are Arabs and Arabs came from the Arabian Peninsula, they are indigenous to the Arabian Peninsula .<br> It is pure propaganda to claim that Arabs are native to Palestine or that the Palestinians are not Arabs.! and why don&#39;t people read about - what is &quot;Sursock Purchase&quot;
These prople cannot give a solution because they are the problem
We have war criminals running.our government!
Very true indeed
&quot;WAR CRIMINALS&quot;
Ive been saying this for years. The only humans rights the west care a out is their own. Everyone else to them is subhuman. There is no such thing as america. Its called west germany.
Jo Biden,, Rashi sunak,,shatenyaho all 3 should be brought before the international criminal court,,
Palestinian population grew 5 times since 1967. Shitty genocide.<br>Also Arabs in Israel enjoy full equal rights. Palestinians don’t because they aren’t citizens of Israel.
Politicks Joe thank you for this interview
Waffen IDF
Bravo Yiannis you are human. Thank you
I just to feel sorry for the holocaust, but not anymore  my hudband told me  that tjey used as propaganda  to get money and for  people to feel sorry for them
Huge respect to Yanis ❤
He is right about Israel and the situation in Gaza and in the West Bank.
l&#39;Allemagne avait son NAZI et les sionistes ont le leur.
😢😢😢
IT&#39;S T H E F T !!!
Yes they are criminals No dought
Sadly the Israelites government together with USA are are arrogant and are conducted a genocide not at all caring if what they did is killing or acts of war crimes..
Thank you, Yannis! We need your voice, urgently! Keep going, 🙏🙏🙏 in the name of justice,  int. human rights and compation for humanity.✌️🤞🌍❤. From Danmark.
Israel has had military supremacy in the region since the 1960s. If they want to kill or remove all ethnic Palestinians what is stopping them?
I generally enjoy listening to Yanis, but he is talking complete rubbish here and deliberately removing all nuance.<br><br>This is Hamas propaganda not truth
Read some history books Yanis
Israel owns the US Congress and POTUS. There are so many AIPAC funded politicians and in the USA. Yet, AIPAC is exempted from filing as a foreign agent.
Thank you Yanis , echo every word you say .  May God bless you with long life of health and happiness ❤️🙏
The more things change the more they stay the same. The Police and military fully support these corrupt individuals so the problem is much bigger than you all talk about.
Billionaire businessman and philanthropist Warren Buffet calls cybercrime the number one problem with mankind, and cyberattacks a bigger threat to humanity than nuclear weapons.
The dark web is also where cybercriminals buy and sell malware, exploit kits, and cyberattack services, which they use to strike victims — including businesses, governments, utilities, and essential service providers on U.S. soil.<br><br>A cyberattack could potentially disable the economy of a city, state or our entire country.
Cybercrime To Cost The World $10.5 Trillion Annually By 2025
Most modern economic systems operate using computers. Attackers can target computer networks of economic establishments such as stock markets, payment systems, and banks to steal money or block people from accessing the funds they need.
What Is Cyber Warfare?<br><br>Cyber warfare is usually defined as a cyber attack or series of attacks that target a country. It has the potential to wreak havoc on government and civilian infrastructure and disrupt critical systems, resulting in damage to the state and even loss of life.

It is too much for kind people to bare
It is heartbreaking to witness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w53SeU11yqs&amp;t=53">0:53</a>  the children being pulled out of the rubble like rag dolls.  We obviously do not live in a democracy anywhere
I admire Veroufakis.
This is correct, the modern state of Israel should never have been created... due to the misguided English sentiment and the UN after the second world war,  feeling sorry for the Jews and their admittedly, inhumane treatment by the Nazi&#39;s.  Isn&#39;t it ironic that the Jews have shown that they are no better than the Nazi&#39;s in their treatment of the Palestinians - unbelievable when one contemplates this!
October 7 was NOT a setback for Israeli intelligence. The government knew that the attack was imminent and they allowed it to occur in order to implement their agenda of destroying once and for all the legitimate state of Palestine!
They are only criminals if the USA, Britain and Germany and their fellow bum boys say so.
Oh, don’t start me on these motherfuckers
Israel is evil and evil are helping them
Thank you very much Yannis for sparking up and standing with justice and humanity
This is one of the clearest, most detailed, yet simple explanation of the conflict and the grave and shameful acts of Israel and their allies. Put a stop to it now and Free Palestine. 🇵🇸
Nethan,Susik,Baden,are Three war idiots
They call Gaza an open prison yet they build tunnels and shoot rockets fighting for what exactlt? Israel was never theirs to begin with, instead of make it a better place for their children. Gazans will never learn.
Yea by whose standards? Hamas?
And the number of Jewish people Biden has in his administration is staggering, only his defence secretary is not Jewish, no wonder America does not want a ceasefire.
The problem is Islam, this is the real issue and their theft and destruction of Israel, the mosque on the mount is simply obscene and the theft of Jerusalem is a hideous crime, why is it ok to kill Jews again, Hitler tricked everyone with nice words, look where it went and the GRAND MUFTI Al Hussein was part of that genocide, a devout Nazis and it&#39;s all FACTS not propaganda
Free Palestine
Thank you Yanis for speaking the truth 👍
Israel is an apartheid, terrorist, occupier NOT A STATE. The only rightful state is Palestine.
Thank you yanni for your support
The worst its that they voted no c3asefire many times. They send money and w3apons.<br>Nobody realize the truth..
What  about  the genocide against  macedonians in  grece in 1948-49....
Thanks for your voice Yanis, we need more like you in leadership positions.
I would argue Yanis&#39; final point. Yes. We in the West are responsible, but indirectly. Our taxes pay for these weapons, but we have no say in where our tax money goes. And there are very few people alive today who were drawing breath when Palestinian territories were first given to the Jewish people to form the state of Israel. I&#39;d hazard a guess that the majority of the populations of the West are against their hard earned money being spent on the decimation of a foreign population thosands of miles away, just like they were against the illegal invasion of Iraq. <br><br>Tarring the citizens of Western nations with the same brush as their crooked politicians, could also be considered collective punishment. Most of us just want to live peaceful lives &amp; see the same for others.And see our taxes spent fixing domestic issues, not fuelling the flames of everlasting war around the world, that only benefits the same wealthy industrialists &amp; elites that control our politicans, and have thereby brought our own countries to the brink of financial ruin.<br><br>I for one would rather see our politicians working towards the benefit of our own country, not throwing our money away on war, because lobbyists for the arms industry &amp; Israel gave them a backhander bribe (sorry.. I mean &quot;political contribution&quot;). The Tories have been in Israel&#39;s pocket for a long time, but it is scary that we now have a leader of the opposition who owes his very position as Labour leader to the Israel lobby&#39;s undermining of his predecessor, via baseless character assassination. Everything points to Starmer being completely controlled by the Israeli state. From his betrayal of Corbyn (a staunch and very vocal supporter of Palestine) and his refusal to acknowledge the findings of the Forde report &amp; restore the whip, forcing him to run as an independent to keep his constituency, to the expulsion of Jewish party members who happen to be opponents of Israeli foreign policy, to backing Israel&#39;s collective punishment &amp; his double standards in calling out war crimes when discussing Putin, versus discussing the actions of Israel since last October. This guy cares more about pandering to a foreign power who are actively seeking to subvert our domestic politics, than he does about the well being of the British public. He is no different to Blair, or the Tories. They all pander to the United States &amp; Israeli governments while leaving us behind.<br><br>Vote Green if you are on the left. Vote Reform if you are on the right. SNP if you are in Scotland. Independent if you have the right candidate. Vote for anyone but the 2 main political parties that have failed us for decades. We need to do ourselves a favour and show these puppets they are not fooling anyone, and plant the seeds of changing our electoral system to proportional representation, so they never have the kind of majority needed to hold absolute power, unchallenged, ever again.
You are a war criminal Rabbi. A real disgrace.
Netenyahu is clearly head of a Apartheid state Israel,still  killing about every day Palestines, occupied Palestines every  day till 1947 and stealing the Palestines land and some if Palestines are called terrorists. The USA are alsi complicit in genocide because the USA give weopans and money to the Jewish Apartheid state. This is disgraceful and the world should be ashamed. Biden is a war criminal and should be prosecuted .I totally agree with your guest
Good Bless you Yanis for tellin the truth.
So many mistakes from such a smart guy. Do you really believe what you are saying?<br>The amount of people in Gaza are growing every year for decades while in your country it the opposite. How is it possible in a “Genocide” ?
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Human rights only for whites.

Yes they are criminals. No doubt about that.
Biden said &quot;don&#39;t react to 7 oct. like We did to 11 Sept.&quot; <br>Yet he immediately Sent arms to Israel and the Navy to the región.<br>What he says AND does are not consistent.<br>HES A LIAR!
He is saying what im feeling!!👍
The IDF believes that they are &quot;justified&quot; for killing Palestinians.<br>But it&#39;s Genocide!<br>The Nazis believed that they we&#39;re &quot;justified&quot; for killing the Jews.<br>It was still Genocide.<br>To quote Bob Dylan.<br>&quot;When Will we ever learn?&quot;
Well done yanis
Well said, all the western leaders are complicit in this genocide
PALESTINIANS ARE THE NEW HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS MINUS 30 000 INNOCENT CIVILIANS INCLUDING 12 300 CHILDREN

Israel&#39;s the number one country that&#39;s fighting terrorism for you in the whole world I don&#39;t care what anyone else believes that&#39;s what I believe
Oh I&#39;m sorry does Israel take hostages and rape women oh and be had babies oh but that&#39;s not real over here is it😂
Talk about war criminals has Israel ever committed rape or terrorism
The number one war criminals in the world right now are terrorists and you don&#39;t even mention them have you ever heard of sanwar at at this time you guys are unreal
THE GREEK IS A DEADHEAD, NEVER BEEN AN ARAB PALESTINE, INVENTED BY THE MUSLIMS IN 1967, TRY READING DEADHEad.
The first genocide didn&#39;t start in 1948. The first genocide started in 1904 - 1908 in Namibia by the Germans. Why is every historian trying to hide from this fact.
United Rogue Terrorist States of US/EU/ISRAEL...
Truly saying it like it is. Gotta love the bold truth.
Theyre war criminals lol he doesnt mention Hamas who is 1000000000000000000X over war criminals though.
Is Murray that to the core pro Israel  supporter listening  or learning.? - his one view is biased and incorrect, Murray s only truth is HIS
The last sentence sums it up.
Exactamente.

Try to see the other side of the picture also. <br>Palestinians are being suffered from a long time. <br>They are the people who gave their lands to Israel in 1949 to live when the whole world wsa not supported them after the Hitlers masacarre. <br>They were the people who supported yahudis, and now the yahudis snatching a them away from their own land.... 😢😢😢😢
Why not going thought the actual history you are just blaming the other side
You are absolutely right that we are don&#39;t support any terror,but freedom fighters is not a terror.
We christian were already informed about war of Israel ✝️

You’re precise and sharp, since I choose my professional stream as an Old Testament. History of Israel is mysterious here I stress “ civilisation begun in Israel”
Wow u r speaking everything in Israel&#39;s point of view and saying no bias. Nd yes the attacks were going on Palestine from beginning where they didn&#39;t get even basic facilities they counter attacked Israel for this. Source of information itself is wrong. The israelis r fighting for al aqsa mosque which is in Palestine, that is why they r attacking the people. Why will someone like to destroy their own peace?  Just think on both sides n not on Israel point of view.
Agreed  violence  and  war  is not the  answer   The  question is  who  is the illegal occupier  and  who   are the unfortunate  ones who  are being  illegally occupied  and  badly  treated  and  who is violating  UN resolutions  who  are  displaced and  living  in refugee camps   for  decades    where is  conscience  gone
What happened to our India shame on Modi chi he has no heart in his body chi very shameful for him he can&#39;t know that how it feel when someone lost their family becoz he has no kids and ni family chi India we all have to take a stand for this ✊if no one help palestine people allah is there so ur days are near allah is seeing all the things

10000 bacha israel ne mar diya firbhi  terrorist nahi
The thing that happened on October 7, 2023, was not a terror attack. That was fighting for freedom, that too since 1948. You should have studied history more before making this stupid video. There was no Israel in the world map before 1948. They came as refugees, which of course Palestinians have allowed and started occupying their land illegally. If fighting for freedom is terrorism, then i guess you are clearly saying that all our freedom fighters were TERRORISTS.
Seems like you&#39;ve been busy bro, not bringing your opinion
😂
😂😂😂  U r saying u will tell only facts so that the audience could decide and set thier perspective .. But u have told everything being one sided .. Funny that u do research one sidedly
I am support Palestine
Netanyahu&#39;s voice is so sexy. So manly. Just love it

Just some foolish parties either terrorists or not are fighting and innocent people are dying day by day i don&#39;t know how even though I dont have any relation to both of the citizens of israel and Palestine but i can feel their pain my eyes turns wet what&#39;s there mistake why are they suffering 🥺 i pray i dua i ardaas i do everything to god please save them I can&#39;t see them longing for their lives🥺😔

Sahi kaha
Umm just a question why can’t Israel just have a war with Gaza and not a conflict with Palestine
Read the Bible brother
I want the daily updates about the Israel- Palestine War.
israel existed before palestine was a name
the romans has named the land of israel, earlier called &#39;judeiya&#39; to &#39;palestine&#39; to remove the connection of jews with it, as it is their historical homeland.<br>the brittish after has kept using the name and called everyone living in it as palestinian. this includes jews, arabs, christians, druz, bedouing and charkes (sorry if I have missed anyone).<br>before the establishment of israel, it was not the arabs calling themselves palestinians - but jews. which then flipped after as anyone who stayed in israel started reffering to themselves as israeli instead, including the arabs that didn&#39;t flee.<br>arabs that have fled israel started calling themselves palestinians in an attempt to gain a &quot;right&quot; for the same peace of land, which despite the un suggesting a partition plan, they just declined on gound of wanting the whole land for themselves and not wanting any jews in it nor a jewish state to be existing. this is also why a two state or a one state solution won&#39;t work now as well. unless palestinians change their way and are happy with what they do have - for example gaza.
PALÄSTINE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<br>❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
bro you forgot the part that izrael was way before palestine
The First Temple in israel was in the period (1000-586 BCE) marks a significant era when the Kingdom of Judah was established in Israel. This shows that   jews lived there before arabs
Palestine wasn&#39;t even identifyed as a thing
Satanism at work!
Wtf right does the UN have to enact a policy of ETHNIC CLEANSING???? <br><br>That&#39;s a crime against humanity, no matter who does it!
Additionally, 3/4 of the Arab population of British Palestine  arrived there in the 20th century.<br>The Arab population jumped from 350 thousand plus in the late  1800&#39;s to around 1. 2 million by 1947-49. <br>Also, the Jewish place names of Jerusalem , Judah, Samaria and the Gallilee all remained as they were. Indigenous Jews and Samaritans still lived there. During the Ottoman period, Palestine was not even an administrative province. It was not on Ottoman maps.
FREE ISRAEL - this is BS!    ISRAEL existed 1205 BC, when Pharao Merneptah mentions that he went to war against them.<br>Israel has existed for 3000 years, while Palestine is a fictional country that has existed for 70 years.
There was no Palestine lol
Zionism said, this is our land according to the bible.😂😂😂
Next ,the white house will be requested by Netanyahu , show us that Israel poor country 😂😂
Free free Palestine
Cough cough: the kingdom of Israel was in the early times but it was captured by the ottomans then the Jews felt and they called it Palestine then comes after ww2 in 1948 a proposal was made for the Jews to return to there home land so they did which was called Israel dummys
Israel is almost 4000 years old. Palestinians was a name given by the Roman Imperator Hadrian to humiliate the Jewish people and erase their identity with their ancestral land. Before this there was any Palestine! On the Egyptian Merenptah Stele, written in 1205 BCE,<br>the Pharaoh Merenptah mentions the Kingdom of Israel and Judah. Before this territory was called Syria Palestine, there was the Kingdom of Israel and Judah!
you are talking about this as if palestine wasn&#39;t just the name of the land because the romans called it that way to humiliate the jews and like britain wasn&#39;t always planning on giving palestine to the jews. look at the palestinian flag during the british mandate, looks pretty jewish to me
Free Palestine
Lets give the Palestinians a damn state, and seek ways to make peace with it (include giving them East Jerusalem, which is mostly inhabited by Muslim Arabs anyway) and provide them economic ways to prosper instead of constantly trying to control their way of life for the sake of security. I think we would be much better off sealing our borders and not letting any of them into Israel, while giving them their own independent way of running an economy such as with an airport, high tech incubation partnerships, and other means that lead to job creation there instead of here.<br>I’m saying this as an Israeli
NAME 1 PALESTINE KING🖕I DARE YOU
Only palestine ❤
Only palestine ❤
It was ALWAYS the Jewish land. It’s promised by God on many occasions in the Bible
Not israel fault for Palestine being weak ;-; <br>Like how british stole other country stuff cause the country were tooo weak to defend itself
🗿
Subhanallah
Free Palestine 🇲🇾❤🇵🇸
Ya Allah please make it easy for the brothers and sisters in Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Thats not true. The Arabs attacked first. And they didn&#39;t had the strongest army in 1948. But anyway again ana again only hate propoganda
Zionists being happy that palestine is being ruled over my israel:😊<br>All the muslim countries joined the chat...<br>&quot;💀💀💀💀💀💀&quot;
I love the fake history. The Israelis had much less than 55%, there are plenty of maps to confirm this. Not only that, they only gained most of it after the Palestinians aka Arabic residents of the region went to war to destroy any Jewish state. If someone doesn&#39;t know, a lot of Palestinians are Jewish by dna. Also they&#39;re only called Palestinians because the Romans hatred of the judaeans, and named the province Palestine. 2000 years ago as a screw you to them. BTW the Palestinians have gone to war every decade or so, some involving the entire region. They gave back the Sinai peninsula after winning the war against Egypt, they gave Gaza to the Palestinians, they gave other territories back too. Hamas was immediately elected and then had complete control of food, water, education, employment etc. So every Palestinian death is because Hamas put them in front of the Israeli fire.
That’s Israel’s territory bro
palestine has never been a state or coutry
Girls that want Ireland hundreds of years ago
History of Israel and Palestine should be read from Canaan era
Free Palestine!
A blatant lie, and most commenters are using this video as a source of information. You should go to jail for things like this.
You completely forgot to mention that as soon as the Arab delegation rejected the UN plan Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon all attack Israel and as a consequence the IDF occupied the more territory as war usually go not bc the suddenly were ordered to and then declared independence. Please don’t spread misinformation
Funded by quatar
Jews were living in Israel for thousands of years long before Palestinians i think you left that part out
Very conviently quitting the country after arming the trained Zionist militia to genocide the native Palestinians
Israaaaaaaieeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllłłlllllllllllllllllllllllłllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllłllllllllllllllll
THERE JEWISH PEOPLE WAS IN ISRAEL FROM OVER 5500 BC. THERE IS NO PALESTINE 😂😂😂😂😂🇮🇱✡️💙🇮🇱🇮🇱💙🇮🇱💙🇮🇱🇮🇱💙🇮🇱💙🇮🇱
Top 10 least misleading news source
The thing is there was never a country called Palestine
This is a Stain on humanity.<br>The UN is corrupt.<br>The holocaust was abhorrent 💯<br>The Palestinians are paying the price for the European holocaust
Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times <br>Europe is going towards it’s hard times <br>Just imagine the feminist human rights activists and the LGBT community in the front line protect for Palestine 🇵🇸 in west <br>Where Iranian and afgani people ready to sacrifice their life for their coming generation
Palestine are Jordanian, Syrian, Levantine, Egyptian immigrants.  There is no difference between them.
The UN is the worst organization in the world!<br>They cause more problems than solve them!
This is all wrong… we need to go back in history. Israel has got independence in 1948, and Palestine in the 60’s or 70’s. + Israel had some kingdoms way before a lot of countries. Kingdom of Israel, kingdom of Judah, and kingdom of Jerusalem, which was older then Roman Empire. Palestine just got independence after empires has took the kingdoms of Israel’s land then collapsed. And a lot of people don’t know history at all, like you so they think Palestine was first because British Palestine was before Israel in 1948. Kingdom of jersualem collapsed or was born in 1099 A.D. and Palestine? I don’t think Palestine was a think before 1099 A.D. and don’t make up something saying Palestinian kingdom or empire in 3847 B.C
Not true. Israel accepted the peel commission with very small land.
Thieves !!!
Bigest colonialism in modern century. Hope Palestine take back all land.
Never blame be human
INŞALLAH ISRAIL FILISTIÑLI HALKA YASATTIKLARINIZI YASAYIN  INŞALLAH.😢
My parents were born in the 1930s when Israel was under British Mandatory and was called -Palestina. on the birth certificate their identify written -Palestine, Land of Israel, Eretz Israel (א&quot;י). In 1948, when the State of Israel was declared by the UN, Arabs who called themselves Arabs remained within its borders. It was only in the late 1960s thr anti Israeli, Arabs countries, decided to call all the Arabs in Israel Palestinians and establish a nation which is actually a brand that will destroy Israel&#39;s existence.  Palestine is already free, it&#39;s become Israel and Jews, Arabs, Christians, Druze, Bedouins, Bahaim live there in freedom of religion and race. Gaza belonged to the Egyptians who didn&#39;t want it back in the agreement of camp David 1977. The Arabs in Gaza are Egyptians and refugees from Africa.
How palestine been created on a jewish land.<br>Make a videos about that
Nice propaganda
Actually to self defense has Palestine not Zionist Israel which is clearly occupier.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Technically Israel is older since before it was Palestine it was the Ottoman Empire and way before that it was the Kingdom of Jerusalem, a Jewish kingdom
1300BCE <br>Moses leads the Isrealites out of Egypt pass the red sea, the beginning of Jewish history.<br>They wandered in the desert for around 40 until Joshia leads them into the promised land.<br>1000BCE <br>The kingdom of David is established.<br>957 BCE<br>1st temple of Solomon built.<br>722 BCE <br>The Assryian exile the Isrealites.<br>586 BCE <br>The Babylon take over and take the Isrealites back Babylon.<br>515BCE <br>The Great return<br>63BCE <br>The Roman take over <br>70BCE Jerusalem is destroyed<br>Palestine is built over Isreal<br><br>I know that there are many who will say this is a lie but if you research properly then you will see that this is the truth
The Israelites were driven from their home their and there where coming back
😢
the british should pay reparations to the palestinians..an also the zionist
free palistine
The name &quot;Palestine&quot; originated from the Romans, who used it to refer to the region after the suppression of the Jewish revolts, particularly the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 AD. The Romans renamed the area from Judea to Syria Palaestina as an attempt to eradicate Jewish identity, connecting the name to the Philistines, ancient enemies of the Israelites. This renaming was aimed at erasing Jewish cultural and historical ties to the land. (The ancient name Judea was derived from Judah, one of the 12 tribes of Israel.)<br>Thus, the people who inhabited the area (including Jews and Arabs) before the establishment of modern Israel became known as Palestinians.
Before Palestine????
And there were other people, nations and religions before Palestine?!<br>That&#39;s history, they betrayed the ottomans and Germans for France and Britain.<br>Losed many wars.<br>And the country they get by UN was19x bigger than today, the rest they losed for alone by starting war and losing.<br><br>A 2 state solution is a pro Palestine solution, because the 1 state solution will be the state Israel.
&quot;plan to partition the country&quot; - partition what country? The non-existing country? It was a plan to partition the land, because it was devoid of a country.
they have to go from were they came or they go to hell..
Man learn history from hamas propaganda 💀
Israel was renamed palistine by the Roman Empire so uh…….yeahhh
Just a 1 sided video dont listen to him
Man in the high castle has more historical accuracy than this video, and man in the high castle is pure fiction
Next vid: How did air become a thing?
United nations is the worst thing humanity has created
Palestine never existed first free Kurdistan ❤❤❤
We already went through all that and we are still suffering from genocide here in Ancient CemAnahuac aka &quot;america&quot;.
That&#39;s why i don&#39;t trust UN
So this explains why the U N does Nothing to  Stop🛑  the suffering of the Palestinian  People,  The United Nations, The  U S, are all complicit in this genocide.  Pure evil!!!
All are Palestinian land. Who give the British the right to create an illegal zionist apartheid regime state of isreal on Palestinian land
1947 the UN, decided jews could return to their homeland. Let&#39;s go back a few thousand years before the land was conquered by Muslim forces shall we? Better look at the land proposed, before believing this video. 4x the size it is now. Isreal has only expanded after being attacked.
How odd that this also looks lile how the Nazis would come in and take over other countries leading up to and during world war 2...subhanallah
The truth
Great Britain defeated the Ottoman Caliphate...  that gave UK the right to decide to recreate a Jewish state.  the Arabs got Iraq Jordan AND half of &quot;palestine&quot; ..  in 1920 hardly anyone was living in &quot;palestine&quot; , ppl started moving in after, Arabs and Jews! ... from all over ... post-WW2 the Victorious nations made up the UN - not the third world clowns who do now - and they were masters of the globe having vanquished the Axis.   WINNERS decide...  Israel accepted partition and chose peace.  Arabs rejected it and chose war... and lost.
For anyone wondering, it was a Palestinian British Mandate. Not an official autonomous state. Before that, there was the ottomans and yadda-yadda.
The region palestina was Jordan   Israel,  part of Lebanon,  part of Syria,  part of Egypt. <br>The palastinian received 75% of the land which is Jordan and the jews who lived in Israel got 25% of the land which was a swamp and desert.  This was agreed by the United Nations more then 75 years ago. The Palestinian, jews, arabs  Muslims and Christians and druz and beduin, which lived in Israel then are still living in Israel in prosperity,  <br>Your wishes to invade Israel will result in <br>Devastating consequences. Why don&#39;t you try to make life for yourself instead of destroying other people&#39;s lives. <br>Hamas is responsible for the suffering of the people of the Gaza strip.
Another example of the UN being absolutely harmful
please me 3000k i ma poor
Israel a été créé par le terrorisme juif nationaliste
Crazy how the people whos “land it is” sided with hitler in ww2 and the un said we will take that. And they did. Its not a “stolen” argument. Its you picked the wrong team.
Yeah and Palestine was named Palestine before Israel was called Israel
🇲🇦🇵🇸❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
And the Arab states attacked and lost
Present situation is opposite in isreal 😢😔😔😔
Im really sad, im Christian and isreal was supposed to be gods chosen land <br>But now isreal is the exact opposite of gods land
what was the palestine president before 1947?
Free Free palestin ❤❤❤❤❤❤
They called it their land cause it was they lived there for years before getting kicked out in a diaspora. It’s the origin and the homeland of the Jewish people they have a right to exist
I know its satirical but this one was just straight up lying and misinformation.
Right in the feels
unlike yall i get my news from a reliable source
WTF😮
I believe the Onion more than BBC &amp; CNN now
man the onion can be incredibly cowardly. really plays into empty-headed least common denominator american snark.
Uh oh guys haha Jesus boys.
I love how the onion avoids controversy by reporting on things 8 years before they happen
🙎🏻‍♀️free America from those who have colonized and plundered the tax resources of American citizens
It may sound repetitive but tragically, this talks about how &quot;hundreds and hundreds&quot; are killed, and now we have tens of thousands being wiped out.
This aged beautifully
No because literally how do they do this every time
This whole “they’re both the same” shit is a stupid lazy stance that allows people to smugly pat themselves on the back for being smarter than both sides even as their government slaughters civilians wholesale. I know it’s 8 years old but Israel has always unambiguously been the aggressor.

This is bullshit.  Where is your courage to tell the truth?
When will TMZ get rights to air this reality show?
This aged like fine milk.
the word genocide is extraordinarily missing from this video. first flop ive witnessed from the onion
An update.?!
It&#39;s terrible that this is more relevant than ever.
It&#39;s funny but not accurate. One side is willing to live with other in peace and share territory, while the other wishes to take all territory and completely exterminate the other. Now here&#39;s the punchline: Israel is the only nation in the ME willing to live along with Palestinians! ha ha ha!
Replace &quot;entertainment&quot; with &quot;arms sales&quot; and the intro is actually a decent description of US support for Israel.
Lmfao, another onion masterpiece
I almost spit out a mouthful of ice tea at the beginning, I didn’t expect the onions take on why they started the Israeli state, for never ending entertainment. Lol
Pointed reminder that Moses WAS NOT REAL, and the Exodus DID NOT HAPPEN<br><br>You&#39;ve bought into a 2000 year old lie that has been thoroughly disproven. The jewish people living in that area (amongst MANY OTHER CULTURES/NATIONALITIES) converted to islam, and you call their descendants palestinians now
&quot;We couldn&#39;t be prouder of both of you...&quot;
Good satire makes you laugh, great satire makes you mad, &quot;yes stupid, you really let them do that!&quot;
If they just went slightly further back and mentioned the first Nakba they wouldn’t be able to “both sides” this shit so hard. Disappointing, but it guess it’s 8 years old.
0 I mean yeah this is a good video and you know is an interesting take and I know this is satire but you mean you kind of left out the part where it is really took their land and I suppose if someone took your home you would just to walk away and turn the other cheek because that&#39;s the American way right? Lol
Now you&#39;re just reporting on reality.
One of the onions greatest pieces
8 years later and it seems like it wasnt a joke
Sometimes I watch satire and think to myself, maybe it was never meant to be funny.
I&#39;m a simple person. I go to satire media outlets to inform myself, and I go to major news outlets to read/watch the satire.
This is a little touchy with me because of all the children I have seen dead the past few months in Palestine with Israel hitting full force.....   thank you for your work though.... very intelligent.
That&#39;s not true either u don&#39;t know history or ur spreading fake news or ur just making it up, plasetine is occupied and isarel is occupier, plasetine is in blockade for decades, isarel repeatedly committed war crimes, plasetine have no control on there state for decades
Man. Sometimes the Onion&#39;s humor is pitch black
It&#39;s Dec 2023 and no updates or corrections are needed with this Onion coverage.
Love this❤
man i really have fun watching this channel but i hate seeing this typa &quot;both sides are wrong&quot; shit. the problem began when the british financed zionism to colonize palestine. up until then the islam majority and the jew minority lived in reasonable harmony. the jews didnt even have to compromise to the sharia law, but the british wanted the population to be divided and to pretend the main cause of the distress was religious conflicts. after so much immigration, specially from europe, two nations developed: israelis and palestinians. the two-states solution has already been picked and is visibly not what the zionists want. the state of israel plans to expel the palestinians from their own land or else kill them right there. palestine needs to be freed from the zionist entity and unified into a single and free territory. the israeli families themselves come each from a different country so why cant both nations coexist? palestinians just want the peace they lost decades ago back and even the israelis are tired of this shit. hamas&#39;s is an antizionist and antiimperialist political organization and is employing the al qassam brigades to fight for national liberation, which the international law considers a just struggle. as sad as it is watching thousands of lives at risk, peace can only be brought by war. if the zionists really cared even about jews or israelis, they would end the occupation right away<br><br>free palestine from the river to the sea 🇵🇸 long live hamas 🇵🇸 death to the zionist entity 🇵🇸
It actually started before WW2
I think after enough time this issue of race or religion will resolve itself, there wont be any left.
Surprisingly prescient.
Non parody gist: people have been fighting over that area for 200,000 years, the most recent conflict is because the western powers decided to make an Israeli state there out of guilt that they stood by Knowingly while Germany killed millions.
😑🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷
There is more truth in this then the other news sources
Comparing Netanyahu to Abbas??? The only thing they share is being corrupt... But if they would compare Netanyahu to Sinwar it wouldn&#39;t be satirical anymore...
Back than it was &quot;hundreds and hundreds more innocent civilians&quot;, now it&#39;s thousands and thousands 😢
Wow 8 years ago
Shit this was sad, very sad!
EXACTLY  😂
this aged well
The part about the uncomfortably heated discussion is still incredibly accurate. I&#39;ve been to a party in a flat during my university years and a guy from Israel and an Egyptian started a discussion about the conflict. It got really ugly at some point, literally screaming in each other&#39;s face and unforgivable insults launched(not youtube friendly, but to get an idea, the moral fiber of many generations of relatives was put into question and bestiality was suggested as a family tradition😅). We had to escort them out ultimately.
Henry Kissinger would be proud.  Celebrating his demise.
This video could have been made yesterday. Shame that it&#39;s still so valid.
I miss good comedy!
As an Israeli - you totaly nailed it! ❤
Free Palestine
As is often the case, The Onion provides the most insightful coverage of this issue.
So successful that it’s still going
Sheer hight-sounding, frivolous, non-factual nonsense from a spectator waiting for more amusement from bloodshed.
😟
Onion is way too good at staying up to date with 10 year old videos
Meant to be satire, but it actually explains pretty well this everlasting conflict.
Hmmm… I wonder why this is in my recommendeds at this specific point in time.
A rare failure of The Onion.  <br>They left out the military industrial complex, the religious sickness, the fact the the West fully backs Israel and that Israel and the West have always been the aggressors.  Ya know, unimportant details like that.
Today the onion would shill hamas
Not quite, but better than most news outlets.
As an israeli I feel represented thank you so much Onion
In 50 years this videp will still be pertinent.<br><br>Or impertinent, I’ll leave it up ro you.
How weird this is 8 years old. I thought it was uploaded in 2023.
life becomes a lot easier when you realise that war is just an other artform that human being perform...
This has not aged a single day 💀
8 years later... and still perfect
I&#39;m glad, We can all agree that it&#39;s the Britishers fault
Well yeah, in spite of this being so old. That pretty much explains it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECscKICzsJ0&amp;t=147">2:27</a> uh oh. Please don’t let this come true
Israel is the side calling for the elimination of their enemy, Palestine is not. I used to like the Onion, thanks for ruining that.
who&#39;s watching in 2023!!!
I guess 12000 plus counts as “hundreds and hundreds”.
This will never get old. Ever.
More sad than funny.
Jokes aside, the most fundamental difference is that Israelis want part of the land and Palestinians want the entire land

and yet one has billions in funding from the US/ weapons/an army, airforce and the other has none of that.
weird how this summary - albeit the onion - makes it sound like this is an even battle. consider The Balfour Declaration in 1917, then watch the map of Palestine <b>MAGICALLY</b> evolve from 1947 to today. did Palestinians sell their land, their homes, or were they forcibly removed and displaced? are they allowed to return, or can they barely leave the concentration camp of Gaza or the fully occupied and policed by Israeli West Bank? hope to see an updated version of this soon!

Had the Palestinians worked with the Jewish nation, they would have been better off than fighting them. This land had always belonged to the Jews. It is their land and the Palestinians never going to get it back. Now if you are a Palestine stop listening to lies of groups like Hamas. Go and educate yourself, get a good job and be happy
„It is a super complex issue and I am really not an expert, but I decided to make a 30 minutes video about it for clicks and views“
It&#39;s interesting there&#39;s no nuance placed on the distribution of land in the UN partition plan. Yes, Israel got a larger share of land, however almost half of that was desert, and habited by the Bedouin, who Israel was going to be expected to take care of. Also, the ethnic makeup of the Israeli partition was something like 60% Jew 40% Arab, with the expectation that civil and religious rights would be upheld for the Palestinian population. The Palestinian partition was somewhere less than 10% Jew, with no expectation of having to take care of anyone else.
Gg
Very poor documentary, very uneducated on the actual history
Israel is a promise land.
Everyone should read The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine by Ilan Pape. An Israeli historian who uses Israeli primary sources. It is the best book on the subject. This issue is not complex. It is unbelievably straightforward.
pretty shallow review:<br>1.  for example, it is indeed true that the Israelis were offered more land, but this &quot;more land&quot; was 80% desert. <br>also, you should have mentioned the real complexity of that.<br> you call the israeli narrative simplistic, but i don&#39;t think you really know what the historical narrative really is...<br><br>2. also, you say Itschak Rabin, and show Shimon Peres. <br><br>3. The Arabs attacked Jews way before 1948, you mentioned the Palestinian suffering alone, and don&#39;t mention the Hebron and Safed massacres in 1928. there is a reason why the Jews didn&#39;t trust the arab population. due to mobs attacks, massacres in the past and so on. <br><br>4. you mentioned the numbers of Palestinian refugees, but didn&#39;t mention the number of Jewish refugees from Arab countries, which approximately reached the same number. <br><br>5. The Arabs refused for any proposal. no matter how much land we would talk about.
From the river Euphrates in the east, to the Mediterranean sea in the west, from the mountains of Lebanon in the north and to the Negev desert in the south, is the promised land for the people of Israel.  If you divide that, disaster comes to you!<br>Study the KJV Holy Bible and be on the truth!<br>Be prepared for the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ...
So the 700 thousand palastinians have the right to return.
Thank you for your courage. You handled a fragile topic well ❤
It’s horrible that we are called anti semetic when  being a Palestinian means you’re Muslim, jewish or Christian. Free Palestine means that we want a secular state that doesn’t insist on jewish supremacy or revenge on a people that did not cause the pain that their neighbors or the Europeans did.
To clarify (if you understand Arabic) the nakba originally referred to the Arab failure to destroy Israel. Read the press of the day. 1948. Nothing to do with Arab Palestinians leaving Israel at the time. What is also ignored is the Jewish nakba - except that Jews have never referred to their own flight as such : Jews were ethnically cleansed from Morocco, Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Yemen in 1948. It has been calculated that these Jews left behind property and land equivalent to four times the size of the newly created state of Israel.
You think this all started with the Ottoman Empire? You need to go back to School and learn History. The Arab invaders have no business being there. There has never been a state or nation called &quot;Palestine&quot;. It was Judea before it was called Israel. You know, where the Jews lived... before the Assyrians invaded and murdered the Jews who lived there... The Jews shouldn&#39;t have changed the name of their land to Israel. They should have kept the original name, Judea.
Once upon a time, there were Jews worshiping God in their land. Then the Assyrians and Babylonian invaders took over, and started to breed like rats.<br>  After many centuries, the Jews managed to reclaim their homeland.<br>The Arabs as they are now known, have been trying to occupy and take over Jerusalem and the entire Jewish state ever since. Why? Because it&#39;s the holiest heart of Christianity and Judaism. This &quot;Islam&quot; exists solely to wage war on Christianity and Judaism, it is not a religion, it is an excuse to subjugate women and wage war on the rest of the world... What more do you need to know?
The enemies news says, it destroyed idf. Why all over the news, ga za is flattened and showing videos of crying? Lies for sympathy?..
There are no traces of you in Palestine. Even the Wailing Wall is Roman, Palestine is Canaanite, Aramaic, Arabic. The stories of the Torah are a figment of the imagination of Ezra, who lived in Iraq. Search for your legends outside the land of Palestine. There are no remains of the Temple and no remains of the palaces of Solomon and David... In the end, the thieves are destined for punishment... Heaven will punish you one day... Return the land to its owners... If Hitler did what he did to you... You did the same thing to the people. Palestinian
Why were the 700,000 Arab Palestinians who were ousted from Israeli controlled areas never absorbed into the countries where they fled, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan. Why are there refugee camps after 80 years.<br><br>What happened to the approximate 700,000 Jewish Arabs that fled their homes in Muslim nations during the same period?<br><br>Why are 20% of Israeli citizens Muslim Arabs who have the right to vote and have membership in the Israeli government?<br><br>How did Egypt administer Gaza and Jordan administer The West Bank and Jerusalem from 1948-1967? Why weren’t those territories given to the Palestinians then?
Imagine the Benjamin$ $pent in order to keep the TRUTH of all this, swept under the table. This has been going on since the water well drilling Co.&#39;s from the UK and the USA discovered Oil and Natural Gas in the Middle East, back in the early EARLY 1900&#39;s. That&#39;s when they started dividing up the lands and pitting one against the other, and Promising &quot;security&quot; and wealth.<br><br>The report cited the Levant Basin Province, comprising 83,000 square kilometers of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, with 122 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, as one of the most important natural gas resources in the world. Despite the fact that this reserve lies under waters bordering occupied Palestine, Lebanon, and Egypt, Israel has claimed sole access and profits from this find. <br><br>While the estimated volume of natural gas in the Gaza Marine is considerably less than the Levant Basin, its proximity to the shore and lesser depth make it easier and less costly to extract. In 2019, UNCTAD estimated the net value of the Gaza Marine natural gas could go a long way in addressing poverty in the region.<br><br>Yet Israel continued to prevent Palestinians from developing and benefiting from their natural resources, in clear violation of international law that governs who has rights to these resources when a country is occupied.<br><br>&quot;Keep them &quot;In And Out&quot; of courts, keep them confused and angry at each other... and We will cash in... sometime soon.&quot;
IT&#39;S NOT CONFLICT,IT&#39;S COLONIAL, ZIONIS CRIMINAL ISRAEL ILLEGAL OCCOPY PALESTINIAN SINCE1938 TILL NOW  AND GENOSIDA/ETHNIC CLEANSING. <br>COLONIALIST IS CRIME Because Stealing people&#39;s property, people homeland.
this is a fantastic video. i just havent been able to wrap my head around any of these horrors that are happening, but after seeing this it seems much more understandable. i dont know what else to say, but i hope more people can think of this with a broader worldview, and i hope, more than anything, that this pain and suffering can come to an end as soon as possible🍉
Benny Morris is a biased historian.  I wouldn&#39;t have used his views.
I would recommend the bible first to get a solid foundation on that conflict before reading anything else.  Especially those of modern times.
You are Wright on   Im a historian <br>And I appreciate your invitation <br><br>History is very important to understand <br>Are moment in time ,and the events the are ocurren like now<br>Horrible event   Painful  to see <br>As a historian , im in pain <br>God help humanity ❤️🙏❤️
The Jews shared Judaea with a host of other peoples whom had been transported there or had moved there on their own accord over the previous few hundred years. The most predominant group was the Edomites, who had moved north when the Jews were exiled. The Palestines are also from Canaan and both sides are related, whether you like it or not, or should I say whether the Zionists like it or not. You focus on the jews but you seldom mention all the peoples who lived in the area and still live there. So because this is a quick, dirty look at  a part of history not showing all the other peoples who lived there. &#39;No let me bring you back to 10 march 1948, a group of eleven men, veteran Zionist leaders together with young military Jewish officers,<br>put the final touches to a plan for the ethnic cleansing of Palestine. That same evening, military orders were dispatched to the units on the ground to prepare for the systematic expulsion of the Palestinians from vast areas of the country. The orders came with a detailed description of the methods to be employed to forcibly evict the people: large-scale intimidation; laying siege to and<br>bombarding villages and population centres; setting fire to homes, properties and goods; expulsion; demolition; and, finally, planting mines among the rubble to prevent any of the expelled inhabitants from returning. Each unit was issued with its own list of villages and neighbourhoods as the targets of this master plan. Codenamed Plan D (Dalet in Hebrew), this was the fourth and final version of less substantial plans that outlined the fate the Zionists had in store for<br>Palestine and consequently for its native population.&#39; This excerpt was written by an Israeli Historian Ilan Pappe.
How could they really blame the Germans for what happened when their prime minister, Churchill, a celebrated stateman, shared the same ideal on race? If we count all the people Britain had killed over their colonial history, would that be another Holocaust?
A thing to add, in all 2-state solutions, from the earliest, the Israeli state was always bequeathed with the majority of the best coastal farmlands.
U S A becomes a nation by the help of the people of Israel.  Nobody knows it. Research it.  God says, blessings to those who bless Israel. Curses to those who cursed Israel.<br>2024, Israel is a rock to the world. Nobody could overturned it. Nobody could get it from Israel!,..,.,
The Palestinian struggle is an anti colonial struggle
Who didnt have their hands in this mess?!? Everyone is pointing fingers at current leaders but they’re all to blame for many many decades!<br><br>Edit: jfc Churchill!
The &#39;complexities&#39; refered to by this documentry are overruled by one simple fact. Palestine was already occupied. That alone negates any claim made by invaders or mythical deity! If on the other hand the argument is &#39;Palestine was conqured&#39; by the west and its inhabitants were kicked out......... why don&#39;t we just admit it?<br><br>Not only does the land belong to the Palestinians but they have a right to fight and recapture it without the west arming Israel to the hilt.  <br><br>Israel should be disarmed of weapons donated to them by the west and left to fight for the land themselves if they feel they&#39;re entitled to it. If they win, it&#39;s their land by conquest. If they lose, they&#39;re out and they will be at the mercy of the people they&#39;ve been mistreating for so long.
When I heard that Churchill quote I stopped the video, went back and listened to it again, because I genuinely thought I missed something. Really glad I&#39;m not the only one, but sad that so many people have been failed by the history curricula of their countries&#39; school systems. (I&#39;m from Germany btw, so we actually learn a lot about racism in our history classes, you know, with the holocaust and all, but Churchill was always the &quot;good guy&quot;)
This is why organized religion sucks. It only leads to more division and violence.
The Roman Empire renamed Judea..Samaria as Syria Palestina.And drove the Jews out. 700 years after Jesus Christ came Islam which is a political doctrine.Muslims were and are Arabs.There is no such thing as Palestinians.They are Arab Muslims.The British Empire renamed that region as the British Empire Palestine Mandate.Empires are who invented Palestine.All of that region is was and will be ISRAEL.AMEN .
Finally, someone honest who calls it how it is and not a Zionist propagandist ... much respect bro 👊
Islam on bill north of Jerusalem? Israel leaven Islam to demonstrated to be future for equality for all and Peace and equality to be on earth. Israel has from beginning for Peace for all respecting. Reality only beset on antiSemitic.
Who were the &quot;absent urban Arab landlords&quot; that sold land to the Zionists and consequently dispossessed Arab/Palestinian peasants?
It is a distraction, and a flimsy excuse, to keep insisting this is a complex problem. It is complex only if one wishes to ignore right and wrong: if that is the case, then all kinds of machinations are handy.  <br>And right and wrong cannot be based on one religion or another.
The quality of this channel in both video and arguments is astonishing, someone may not agree with everything but it’s impossible to not recognise the great effort and passion behind
Way too little time made of use for this subject. Thats your main issue if you are afraid your video has any
Forget about history of Israel and Palestine. What can you do them now ? How can you possibly bring peace and do better living for Palestinian. How can you bring friendship between Israelites and Palestinian.
This only proves, Islam is true!
Oh no. This trouble all started on Oct 7... apparently...
It makes a lot of sense now. Why do Israelis treat Palestinians the way they do because the British were the ones doing it first using people as human shield, but they want to wash their hands with history.
Excellent video, bro❤

It’s not complex <br>A global imperial wealth sucking country UK invaded Palestine a geostrategic land to sustain dominance in the energy rich and most important global trade region the Arab world <br>Used European Jews as mercenaries and agents of colonization <br><br>Yet <br>Arabs <br>As always <br>will soon free their land from this savage terrorist western occupation <br><br>Free Palestine 🇵🇸
I think is a very balanced and fair video about the conflict. Some details could be added, but then the video would soon be an hour long. Here are a few important ones:<br><br>- The terrorism in the few years leading up to 1948 was very one-sided. In 90% of the cases it was Jewish groups inflicting terror on Arabs and British to drive both out of Palestine. This terrorism wasn&#39;t some small rogue actors, but came from the highest command, including Ben-Gurion. The British knew this, because they secretly wiretapped the Jewish leadership. They decided to raid Jewish offices, and collected very damning evidence for it, which they stored in their HQ at the King David hotel. The Jewish leadership panicked and had their terrorists blow up the hotel to destroy the evidence.<br><br>- The 1947 UN partition plan was initially going to be voted down, but the Zionists and their powerful allies stalled, then bribed and threatened a few countries to change their vote in favor of the Zionists. This was the first major task of the newly formed UN, and many asked themselves how it already could be corrupted so easily.<br><br><br>- While there were many kinds of Zionists, the political Zionists soon became the dominant ones. They never had any intention to share any land with the Arabs. Their goal right from the start was to take all of the land. They agreed to the 1947 partition plan just as a first step of getting all of the land. This attitude has continued to this day. Israeli settlers is the clearest sign that they never had any intention to allow a Palestinian state.<br><br>I can strongly recommend the Martyr Made Podcast on this subject. Several hours of detailed info narrated in the style of Dan Carlin.<br><br><a href="https://www.martyrmade.com/featured-podcasts/fear-loathing-in-the-new-jerusalem">https://www.martyrmade.com/featured-podcasts/fear-loathing-in-the-new-jerusalem</a>
A Jew will always tell you what happened to him, but never tell you why... <br>Russian proverb

this poorly researched video is disgustingly antisemtically framed.

I ALWAYS point people to this channel when trying to understand some of the most incomprehensible conflicts in the history of humanity.  Thank you so much for the work you do.  This is excellent, per usual.
The incredible writing, your narration and the editing of these videos is out of this world. Thank you for your very important work.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdENyo4HvX4&amp;t=1050">17:30</a> It should be noted that a significant part of the 57% of Jewish territory would be comprised of the Negev Desert.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdENyo4HvX4&amp;t=974">16:14</a> You miss out one crucial detail. A damning one for the British. They criminalised Jewish immigration to Palestine in 1939. Even more damning is the fact that they then place illegal Jewish immigrants into Detention camps in Cyprus after the war.
A concisely comprehensive documentary. Ashamedly, I come to this subject not with an open mind. Like so many in the West, I&#39;m the dupe of decades of political and media brainwashing: Israel, good; Palestine, bad. Your video has corrected this fallacy. I now see that for more than a century, the Palestinian Arabs have suffered a monumental injustice, which has proceeded in plain sight right up to the genocide of today. Since October 7th, 24,000 Palestinians have been slaughtered, and nearly half of them have been children. History echoes with the sickening emptiness of the words &quot;never again.&quot;
One could wish that Netanyahu would make the world his classroom and present this history in detail and ask us to hold sympathy for all the people in these places, as most of us now feel after watching this.
Thank you for the video and the book reccomendations
I know that if we were to go through all the quotes from any political figure of the early 1900s we would eventually come across, at the bare minimum, with some mildly racist comments. I sincerely believe that this would be true even for the most progressive minds of that time. <br><br>Nevertheless, that particular quote is disturbing even for it&#39;s time...
You cherry pick Muslim perspectives. Most of them are not valid. You point out times Jews did bad stuff, but ignore all the times they did bad stuff. You seem to want to put out a balanced perspective, but you really haven&#39;t.
You can not judge God by saying to him he is liar, God is the judge not you
If the people have tried to make the human robotic super man for the absolute progress, therefore they shall deserve infinite heavens, but why God does not perform that pragmatically
Thanks for being so thorough and precise. Not taking sides, or at least, almost not taking sides. Anyhow I&#39;d just like to add that you forgot to mention, hopefully  unware, that the very creation of Jordan as an Arab state on BRITISH PALESTINE, constituted the creation of...AN ARAB PALESTINE. Shortly before saying &quot;twice promised&quot; you showed a map of Palestine in purple. However, that was not the full lenght and size of the real Palestine under British mandate. That said, the obvious conclusion is that although the UK had given the portion of land to a NON Palestinian arab from the Hashemite tribe, that country created on top of British Palestinian land is nonetheless PALESTINE itself. We can conclude without shadow of doubt that the division of the remaining land between Jews and Muslims was not over the entirety of Palestine. Thus, Arabs/ muslims control over 80% of Palestine , whereas the Jews, only 20%. That is an important fact to be put into consideration.
The on-going war in Palestine, where Israel keeps pummeling Palestine has become a first rate tragedy for the whole world; is it not ! In this developed world with AI and what not this tragedy has been dragging for the past 70 odd years. Is there no solution for this seemingly un soluble tragedy.  I as a citizen of the planet, has spent a lot of time when sleep eludes me.  This is the proposal.  The state of Israel could be statutorily dissolved.  Do not take me wrong and I do not advocate the death of a single Israeli or Palestinian for that matter.<br>Israel has about 8 million citizens.  Suppose Israel supporting countries led by America which un-equivocally support Israel paying a heavy diplomatic price for that support could take in about 2 Mn Israelis into America and so could large countries like Canada which a huge land mass but no populace, Australia which is more or less the same. Both these huge countries could take in say 1 Mn Israelis each.  In the case of Germany, it has a special a nexus with the world Jewry in part due to it Holocaustian past from which collective ‘guilt’ still emanates.  Germany took in l Mn Syrians in to their country and Syrians are different from Germanic races. Not so, Israel.<br>There are other European countries like Portugal, Italy, England et. El.  How France; another nexus laced with ‘guilt’ as the Vichy Govt.,deported a large cohort of Jews to crematoriums in Germany. Now, we are almost there. Some could even find citizenship in North Korea; should not be surprised at all. Isralis could send rockets to space more efficiently unlike NK made ones which disintegrates in mid-air. Russia which has a decreasing population problem could accommodate 1 Mn Israeli’s and send them to develop Siberia. Even Iceland could accommodate Isralei Jews and send the down to places where volcanoes erupt so as to deal with them. <br>So what of the now emptied state of Israel, which now no more (Muslims all over the world would be salivating at that prospect and these lands could be turned over to the long suffering Palestinians who would be happy to occupy the lands they lost at the creation of Israel.  I conclude and would be happy to elaborate re my ‘brain child’ to anyone who is interested in a ‘win’ ‘win’ situation for all the stakeholders.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdENyo4HvX4&amp;t=1350">22:30</a> those words could have been said by Hitler..but it was Churchill. Shame !!!!!!!!!
Thank you so much for this video, I honestly had no idea of half of this, I feel I have a much better of the situation now.
I cant help but to feel like this presentation is purposefully much more favourable towards the Palestinians. It seems like the narrator ponders for minutes on all the Jewish wrong doings will just briefly mentioning all the massacres the Palestinians committed.

One commenter said you were yt formatting wiki pages and a couple later someone links to wiki. This despite you citing the 3 books you chose as sources at the beginning of the video. I personally found it to be pretty fair from my own previous understanding so thank you.
This is the slanted Zionist Hasbara.
the jews always had a presense in the middle east, and racially, jews are of the exact same race as the people of the middle east, jews and palestinians are both over 70% decended from canaanites, so there is no such thing as anti semitism in the middle east, only when israel was created on palestinian land did we see a rise of hatred for jews, and often focus on hatred of eurpean jews who where more agressive in their ideology of wanting to create a state, and who used significant violence against palestinians.
Skipping back and forth between years and decades made this too confusing to me.
You make ethnic cleansing seem so friendly and necessary. And in the end you admit, that you are not an expert. Useless information. I listened! Free 🇵🇸
Listening to your channel&#39;s rhetoric, I have come to the conclusion that your staff has very nicely &quot;YouTube-formated&quot; Wikipedia content. So, good job for views. Not so good for truth and fairness.
👁✍️🏻🧍‍♂️?
Some details were glossed over including,<br>1) how Arab population which was less than 200,000 in the 19th century to 700,000 in 1948. It was because the Jews who purchased land invigorated the economy of Palestine such that Arab economic migrants started coming into Israel for their livelihood.<br>2) that the naqba came about when the invading Arab leaders told their fellow Arabs to leave Israel so that it would facilitate the extermination of the Jews. That they ended up refugees after the loolss of the Arab armies is a natural consequence of their treachery.
It&#39;s &quot;exacerbated&quot;, not &quot;exasperated&quot; !! So much poor grammar by youtubers is exasperating!
Hey there, really nice effort but the problem with using any Islamic sources is that they are bound to be peddling falsehoods <br><br>Such “history” books are written for the West, as all believers  are commanded by Allah to lie to Kafirs.  <br><br> So your information is already wrong when you say that they were half a million Arabs in the early 1900s!<br><br>So here are the accurate facts and it’s a shame that you did not bother to check them before making your documentary. <br><br>You must always check facts. If they come from an Arab sources for the West, they are duty bound to lie about virtually everything.  Anyone who does not see the matter of this mid East conflict as relatively straightforward, has been confused, deliberately, by an onslaught of propaganda, coming out of Islam. Sadly, your effort only adds to that narrative, which is fundamentally false.<br><br><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region)</a>
Its about what state you want, an ethno or a multicultural state,
So you got this people that show up to a land that other people are already living there and they say our God gave us this land and kicked the people there out. Then they got kicked out then they came back and kicked the people out there then they got kicked out then they came back again and are currently kicking the other people out. So history teaches us and repeats itself that the hebrews will once again  kick out the  people there in that land then they themselves will get kicked out.  This is a very god documentary but it should have started around about 1000 bc.
Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. The Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the Lord, who had appeared to him.<br>    ---- Genesis 12:6-7
I admire that you seem to neither condemn nor defend either side in this tragic conflict. I am left feeling that this a complicated problem with many points of view.
Jordan Soldierts rocking Jewish from old Jerusalem  and destroy most Jewish history from old Jerusalem. No Jewish on Jordany last. Clearly Israel and Jewish did not tray to destroy Arab on land and even on 6 day war was as ending war Israel helped return Arab People on land by helping Arabi cross Jordan wall. and even clearly to teach Peace, Israel lets Islam to continue on Hait Holy Jerusalem to keep asking tempt to respect and respect all religious to visit it. So da Islamic not only fight between couple Islamic but also clearly prohibit Jews to pray religious. &quot;Peace&quot; ???
Funny not to clear come History and forget plenty. Jewish seems only by Europe, to forget dat Jewish leaving on land by longest dan any overt people regardless by all people trying to take over. Arab also started to incoming bigger dan earlier dan some pretend. Arab started to move every body. as lost time of Turkey one may understand amount of people and how small on land dat Turkey treated like so small dan using for Suirti. Jerusalem was mixed but only few having it last great. Turkish and Arabic Islamic did not care of such important. Any way as Arab went in went by seeing Jewish and also Arabik killing not also politic but criminal dat shown plenty careless. It was not even a name of trying an in dreaming name until 1961 dat PLO head (a Egypt born) competed all his groups to take &quot;Palestine&quot; and even writing &quot;to take name of Pelestinewould be good to invented a History to used&quot; so we must not learn. Now, plenty to have equality and respect has tray many times, Now way &quot;Palestinian&quot;PLO&quot; never compleat Peace regardless plenty to observe. Now read plenty of PLO as well as majority teacher day declared a country without Jews and also declared to kill Jews completed and learned plus antiSemitism taking Hitler and Nazis papers plus plenty of teaching and friendly for such &quot;Arabi&quot; becoming and continue Nazi politic plans. So all creates with we may not have by two people on Peace. Criminal and defense really shows way it is only Jewish Israel works Humany and accepted for Earth . How to do would only teaching wrong Arabi &quot;Palestinian&quot; dat Jews are Human and accept Peace.
Churchill did not hold anything back. 😮
This video has a GLARING omission. I&#39;m not Jewish nor Arab. But the Zionist response to the 1939 White Paper is kind of crucial. They rejected a democratic state with representative government and literally resorted to terrorism against the British in 1939. THen came WWII and the holocaust, during which they paused their activities. Once the war ended, the zionists launched a campaign of terror against the British, who had just saved European Jews from Hitler, and that caused England to flee the region. During this time the 1939 white paper was in effect and being implemented. All the jews that had arrived there got there illegally. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that nearly all Jewish immigrants to palestine between 1882 and the start of the British Mandate were illegal immigrants as well.<br><br>This is the crucial piece of the puzzle that explains why the Zionists were seen as violent extremists by the British and the Arabs, and explains why that 1947 partition plan was so ridiculously unjust compared to the 1939 white paper plan.  It also exposes the true motivations of the Zionists who had NO intention in living in an arab majority state even though the Arabs were literally the majority and that this is the foundation of democracy.
It’s not complicated at all. The Muslims should have GIVEN Israel to the Jews as their historic homeland. It’s still possible. Muslims should do that today. It would be the right thing to do - and save Muslims from their curse of backwardness and religious obsession.
thank you for this
You forgot the Bible.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdENyo4HvX4&amp;t=1380">23:00</a> I am speechless
Even though this video goes against many of my feelings I find it educational.
Thank you for this report. I learned much.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdENyo4HvX4&amp;t=470">7:50</a> &quot;Or, may be, they have chosen to ignore [Arabian villages]&quot;. Conspiracy? Hundreds if not thousands travelers described desert and barren land. These observers were independent, came from different countries, different religions, during prolonged time. All of them reported the same observations. Modern science also reports the same, very low precipitation with obvious consequences. What did you smoke?
The 60% of the land that went to the Jews included the negative
The sad story of man.  The opressed if given the opportunity will become the oppressor 😢
Truly hard to accept some decisions made by very famous people. 😢
Settling in the only part of the Middle East that has no oil, as Hitchens commented..
The pro Palestine  comments have gone quiet?
支持巴勒斯坦，爱来自中国🇨🇳❤
Based on this as neutral as it was made still shows that Israel continued to take over the space that was original to Palestine and it literally explains they have been controlling Palestine territory for a long time. Palestines don’t need to be controlled in their own land.
So in 1700 the Jewish people settled there and the rest are colonizers?
So, Ottoman Empire lost in WWI, doesn&#39;t that mean Palestine technically is still Allied ( British ) country?
Let’s get this straight the Land of Canaan  was called palestina by the Roman Empire there was never a land called Palestine or people called Palestinian they came about in 1960 so let’s stop the bullshit that Palestinian were there for many centuries it’s all bullshit that’s a fact end of story
This video is pro-Palestinian. And not mentioning who started all the war
The pie chart showing my the percentage of land allocated to each side was wrong. And it’s not “sixty-day” war it’s six-day, you’re saying it wrong.
Don&#39;t need this video. just got to read the Bible all these questions are answered and no secret!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Small correction. During the time of the ottomans, the entire area that is today syria, jordan and israel was called syria palestina. Syria was given to france in the sies pico agreement. Britain divided palestina into ywo and gave the eastern part of palestina to the Hashemite family from Saudi arabia as a gift for they help in first world war. There for the arabs actually received a much bigger area then the jews. and most jordanian are actually palestinian.
how long was the six day war?
IT WAS A 6-DAY WAR. 6 DAYS NOT 60. ... 6, AND ONLY 6.
This video hides a lot of informations .... When Abraham and his family came to the area it wasn&#39;t empty, it was fully populated. That population are the real palastinian ... Abraham is a Kurdish man and prophet of God
Considering what is going on in 2023-2024 this is an important historical background to everything going on.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rfmvids">#RFMvids</a>
1928-Haj Amin al-Husseini (&quot;Plastilin&quot; movement creator)encouraged a Jews massacre.<br>1941 - HA- Husseini met with Hitler to encourage the &quot;final solution&quot; in Israel and Europe.<br>1974 - Plastilin kidnapped 115 Israelis, mostly school children, and killed 31 of them.<br>1993 - Israel pursued peace with “Plastilin” invention on the Oslo Accord.<br>1994 -  “Plastilin” unleashed suicide bombers on buses, leading to horrifying scenes.<br>2005 - Israel evacuated Jews from Gaza; Gaza  “Plastilin” turned it into a state of terror.<br>07/10/2023 - THIS TIME Plastili FILMED THEMSELVES DOING WHAT THEY DO SO THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CAN SEE.
The Truth is that Barbaric migrants are being flushed out of Jewish homes they invaded and are being rightfully returned to Israelis.<br>In Europe Barbaric Migrants are invading and colonizing the white indigenous people and living of welfare the migrants and their fore fathers never paid into.<br>The fake suffering of the poor poor plasticine creatures is the product plasticine Leaders  make money from , the donations pouring in allows them a luxurious standard of living.<br>Why would the plasticine Leaders want to get ride of multi billion dollar product?  why would activists want to get ride of the product that gives them a cause?<br>plasticine is the biggest lie of the 21st centaury.
Aside from the Belfour agreement,  our Askinazi brothers have no legitimate tie to the lands of the Middle East. <br><br>Palestinians do.
just letting the creator of the video realize a mistake: Its 60 day war not six.
Ancient israelites are not modern Israeli
So...60 million have seen this story full of holes and innaccuracies..? 60 day war? When was that??<br>BTW.. what happened to all Jews expelled from Arab countries? Now what happenned to Arabs expelled? Actually arabs were not expelled. They were told by their leadership to leave and could return weeks later after arabs won. The  only problem being Israel did not lose that war. the Arabs that chose to stay in Israel have voting rights careers and sit in Parliament. none of those qualifies as apartheid. Nor does a massively growing population qualify  as a genocidal rule
Cannan was originally inhabited by hunter/gatherers and soon mixed with people from Persia and Turkey. Abraham came to Cannan and settled there for 100 years after that. He then went to Egypt where the Jewish people were enslaved. They returned and defeated the various Cannanite groups. This video conveniently skips over the perspectives of the other groups that resided there
&quot;sixty day war&quot;
انا لا اتكلم اللغة الانجليزية بشكل جيد لذلك ساتكلم بالعربية هنالك شيء نسيت ان تذكره وهو ان قبل وجود مملكة يهوذا كان الكنعانيون الذين ينتمي ليهم بني اسرائيل  لم يكونوا يهودا وكان بني اسرائيل يعيشون كقبائل منفردة عن باقي الكنعانيين مع مرور الوقت اتت مملكة يهوذا واتبع الكثير اليهودية ثم بعدها المسيحية ثم بعدها حدثت مشكلة بين الدولة الفلسطينية  والمسلمين  ملاحظة المسلمين لا يقومون بالفتوحات او بالجهاد الى في حال بدأت الدولة المقابلة في ايذائهم  و هذا شيء اساسي في الاسلام  بعد ان دخل المسلمون فلسطين كان يعيش في فلسطين مسيحيين ويهود لم تعامل الدولة الاسلامية المسيحيين واليهود بطريقة سيئة بل ايضا سمحوا لهم في ممارسة دينهم بحرية واذا كنت لا تصدقني ابحث عن هذا بنفسك حتى انها سمحت لهم بتولي مناصب في الدولة واتبع الكثير من اليهود والمسيحيين الديانة الاسلامية واصبحوا مسلمين لذلك فإن فلسطين تنتمي للفلسطينين لانهم الكنعانيون الاصليون الذين عاشوا فيها من الاف السنين و هي لا تنتمي لليهود لان الصهيونية تنص على اقامة دولة لليهود الذين هم اصلا ليسوا من الكنعانيين بل هم ما نسميهم بالاشكناز يهود اوروبا الذين اتبعوا الديانة اليهودية وليسوا من الشعوب السامية مثل العرب لذا من النفاق ان يقولوا معادي للسامية على الرغم من عدم  كونهم من الشعوب السامية على الرغم من ان العرب من الشعوب السامية لكنهم يعاملوا بعنصرية ويعتقد انهم ارهابيون و مجرمون هذا نفاق وهذا معادي للسامية لان العرب من الشعوب السامية
Palestine will be free despite of the zionists noises . This is the promise of Allah for us in Quran and Sunnah .😊<br>The Islam is the religion which will win in the last of dunya time ❤☪️
so this land belongs to Israel , cus they had the land first before Palestinians come in
I wonder what the support would look like if Palestinians and Jews were switched. If the arab world was a Jewish world, and Palestine&#39;s were the only arabs living in a world of Jews. Exiled from the land multiple times over centuries, then had half their people killed, and tried to come back to their homeland. Land taken from Jews who eventually became occupied by Palestinians. Who would be right? Both sides, or one side. Two station solution...? It&#39;s a hypothetical scenario. Not taking a side, so if you&#39;re gonna hate do it somewhere else.
Like all nations, Israel and Palestine is built on conquest. Can’t see anywhere why Israel should be worse than anyone else in that regard. Earth belongs to no one, and everyone, it’s all about power. Sore losers it seems. Also they denied the first treaty and went to war from what I can see.
Not real this Palestine land
وبحسب القرآن الكريم - أعطى الله أراضي دولة إسرائيل لليهود بني إسرائيل. هذه إرادة الله. ولذلك فإن أي محاولة يقوم بها الفلسطينيون للاستيلاء على الدولة اليهودية تتعارض تمامًا مع الإسلام.
According to the Holy Koran - Allah gave the territory of the State of Israel to the Jews, the sons of Israel. This is the will of Allah. Therefore - any attempt by the Palestinians to take over the Jewish state - stands in total opposition to Islam
I am currently learning this topic in school admis what is happening right now in Palestine. I am learning so much more than I ever would because of how much my school loves to glorify America, and the soul topic of U.S. history. I loved this video and it was very helpful!

Islam I evil
Dear, It’s hard for me to believe that you don’t know the details of the creation of the state of Israel and the illegal formation of “transjordan”. This means that you are well aware that no state of “Palistine” has ever existed, just like the “people of Palestine”. These so-called “people of Palestine” are the descendants of Arab migrant workers who came to Israel from neighboring Arab countries after the start of Jewish immigration at the beginning of the 20th century.<br>    Can you really imagine that the creation of ANOTHER ADDITIONAL new Arab state will change anything? And this is in the presence of 22 Arab and 38 Muslim countries, occupying an area of more than  13 million square  kilometers?! I hope you will agree that this is not a territorial conflict at all, but an existential conflict. <br>   This was openly stated by Mr. Erdogan, who claims leadership in the Islamic world, threatening war with complete destruction of “the Jews, the crusaders and all infidels.”  If you are not Muslim, then you are definitely among the infidels who are subject to complete destruction.  I am sure that you are aware of this and understand that this is not a slip of the tongue of an “inexperienced politician.”  It&#39;s time to stop turning a blind eye to the obvious.  <br> <br>                   There is a war of Islam against the WHOLE WORLD.<br>                  Israel simply found itself on the first line of defense !!!<br>             Meet this :   Islam and global jihad - WAR AGAINST ALL MANKIND!<br> <br>Allah has decided to destroy all the infidels and the unclean. And he started with Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah and Iran prepare to accept the wrath of the Almighty ! <br>                                 !لقد قرر الله تدمير جميع الكفار والنجسين. لقد بدأت مع حماس في غزة. حزب الله وإيران يستعدان لقبول غضب الله تعالى!<br> <br>1. Before Israel, there was a British mandate, not a Palestinian state<br>2. Before the British Mandate, there was the Ottoman Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>3. Before the Ottoman Empire, there was the Islamic state of the Mamluks of Egypt, not a Palestinian state.<br>4. Before the Islamic state of the Mamluks of Egypt, there was the Ayubid Arab-Kurdish Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>5. Before the Ayubid Empire, there was the Frankish and Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem, not a Palestinian state.<br>6. Before the Kingdom of Jerusalem, there was the Umayyad and Fatimid empires, not a Palestinian state.<br>7. Before the Umayyad and Fatimid empires, there was the Byzantine empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>8. Before the Byzantine Empire, there were the Sassanids, not a Palestinian state.<br>9. Before the Sassanid Empire, there was the Byzantine Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>10. Before the Byzantine Empire, there was the Roman Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>11. Before the Roman Empire, there was the Hasmonean state, not a Palestinian state.<br>12. Before the Hasmonean state, there was the Seleucid, not a Palestinian state.<br>13. Before the Seleucid empire, there was the empire of Alexander the Great, not a Palestinian state.<br>14. Before the empire of Alexander the Great, there was the Persian empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>15. Before the Persian Empire, there was the Babylonian Empire, not a Palestinian state.<br>16. Before the Babylonian Empire, there were the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, not a Palestinian state.<br>17. Before the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, there was the Kingdom of Israel, not a Palestinian state.<br>18. Before the kingdom of Israel, there was the theocracy of the twelve tribes of Israel, not a Palestinian state.<br>19. Before the theocracy of the twelve tribes of Israel, there was an agglomeration of independent Canaanite city-kingdoms, not a Palestinian state.<br>20. Actually, in this piece of land there has been everything, EXCEPT A PALESTINIAN STATE.<br>(Borrowed from a friend)<br>A little more history for those wanting to &#39;restore Palestine&#39;.<br>In 132 AD the Emperor Hadrian resolved to stamp the Jews and their religion out of existence. He sold all Jewish prisoners into slavery after the revolt of Bar Kikhba, forbade the teaching of the Torah, renamed the province Syria Palaestina, and changed Jerusalem’s name to Aelia Capitolina. He renamed Israel to wipe out the national identity of Israel and the Jews.<br>So if you are looking to &#39;restore Palestine to the Palestinians&#39;, you need to give it back to the Jews.
The “forgetful” presenter did not say that the Arabs once captured the entire Middle East and northern Africa with Fire and Sword, destroying almost the entire male population of all countries. She “forgot” to tell that after the end of WWII, Britain and France, as the victorious countries, received instructions from the League of Nations to rebuild the defeated Ottoman Empire. Both countries received Mandates from the League. And new countries were created: Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and others. Under the Mandate for Palestine, Britain was supposed to help create a Jewish state on the territory of the former Jewish state.<br>In 136 AD. The Romans expelled the unconquered Jews from their country. They plundered the Temple and... built the Colosseum in Rome. And in the arena of this Colosseum they began to openly demonstrate their morals, against which these rebellious Jews fought. In the Colosseum arena, men had sex with men, and women with various animals, including wild ones. The cannibals chopped and tore each other into pieces, devouring the defeated opponent for the amusement of the spectator. And in order to further humiliate the Israelis, they renamed the country “Palestine,” which in Hebrew is consonant with “plundered.”<br>In WWI, Britain was ready to enter into an alliance even with the devil in order to gain victory. And after the victory, having received the Mandate, she farmed it out to one nomad brother - the bandit Iraq. Other countries had already been formed. Another nomadic brother, a bandit, began to make claims against Britain, recalling to her his past merits. Wanting to pay off, Britain divides Mandatory Palestine into parts and gives 66% to a bandit - a sheikh. This is how “Transjordan” appeared, on the territory of Left Bank Israel. With Hitler&#39;s rise to power, Britain issued a White Paper and, based on “humane considerations,” severely limited Jewish immigration. . At the same time, Britain made great efforts to drive Arabs from different countries to these desert lands.<br>The remaining part of the Mandate was cut into separate unconnected pieces and given to the Jews. These were mainly malarial swamps and waterless deserts.<br>Jews fleeing pogroms and anti-Semitism agreed to such a division. But the Arab League, an ally of Hitler, did not even consider the possibility of providing asylum to Jewish refugees. The Arabs were confident in their strength. They have been acting by force for centuries and destroying everyone in their path.<br>This is how Muslims created the “Beautiful Country” - Pakistan, at the cost of the lives of 60 million Hindus.<br>The Arabs attacked Israel immediately after the announcement of the creation of a new state. In addition to the five surrounding countries, three more countries sent their troops. Leaving Israel, Britain not only took away all the weapons, but also declared an embargo on the supply of both weapons and food to the young country. British officers with WWII and WWII experience led many Arab armies and divisions in the war against Israel. All Arab countries in the region expelled the Jews, most often with a bundle of things in their hands, but sometimes without things. In total, the Arabs expelled about a million Jews. Some went to South. America, Australia, but more than 650,000 were accepted and assimilated by Israel, whose entire population then amounted to 650,000 people. And that&#39;s not the whole story...
Zionist Vulgar Propaganda that you can swollowed.
😂😂😂. Palästina???<br>Palästina= Europa !
You missed the point that Jews &amp; Christians lived in the land were already arabs as some of them converted for various religions, you also didn&#39;t mention the facial features between them and the European refugees came from Europe to colonize others.
lol, ppl and cartoonish explanations.
Here you go not even a religiously biased video just pure historical facts of the Israelites inhabiting the land that belonged to them before the Palestinians and Muslims were even in existence
Nice white washed history. Calling the nakba the Israeli Arab war is so ignorant it&#39;s crazy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m19F4IHTVGc&amp;t=553">9:13</a> you didn’t mention WHY it was offensive. Ariel Sharon was involved with the Qibya massacre where two thirds of the people were women and children killed. Yes, it was in response to an Israeli mother being killed with her children, but first off, did they bring a court case of it, and second, what justifies the right to massacre an entire village who didn’t do anything to this woman? This is why the second intifada happened, he was no good man.
JUST PEACE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pxEUbd3fz_Q">https://youtube.com/shorts/pxEUbd3fz_Q?si=s4_vKauBbz887KuL</a>
This is why religion is foolish. Because blood is spilled over unprovable Fairy tales. The UN just needs to declare that region neutral international territory. If they cant learn to share, then no one should have it.
Lowkey just watched this cause people in my personal circle is boycotting American businesses for doing business with Israel and it’s so dumb to me cause it’s literally Israel taking back their home after surviving the holocaust
as they say from the mountain to the sea it will be !
The choice is simple for new generations of inhabitants of that region: Do we want to focus on past conflicts and prolong the suffering? Or do we want to focus on peace in the present and future? If we choose to continue focusing on revenge or &quot;righting past wrongs&quot;, there is no hope for peace. If we allow the past to remain in the past, and focus on the fact that we all just want peace, then there is hope going forward.

No mention about Oct 1973 war ? which led towards 1979 peace agreement ? Without this war, Saini wouldn&#39;t have been given back to Egypt
Thank you for creating and sharing.
I am Palestinian, and let me summarize the issue for you with all honesty and impartiality.<br>The short answer is that the conflict is religious first and ethnic second.<br>The long answer is:<br>Regarding religion: The Jews first, the Christians second, and the Muslims third, consider it a holy land and the Savior will come from it, etc. That is why they will do anything to obtain it, no matter how dirty the method is, as long as it is analyzed in the Holy Books.<br>Regarding race: Of course, the superpower in the world is white and the Jews are of the same race, and they will automatically defend them, especially after Hitler did to them. Of course, like young children, they will be allowed to do whatever they do.<br>Now, if we ignore the religious and ethnic issue, how do we know the conflict???<br>Now the Israelis say that they (the people of the Jewish religion, not the race) have been living on this land for thousands of years, and this region was called Israel, but during the blood-filled history of humanity they were expelled, and somehow (the Palestinians) lived there at some point, but certainly it is older than 1,500 years. Well, I want each of you to think, if every country thought like the Jews, what would the state of the planet be like??<br>Look, I do not blame the Israelis for invading the Holy Land and expelling, killing, destroying, raping, etc., the population there, because the history of humanity is based on conquest and colonization, and the strong have the right to eat the weak, because we live in a dark forest anyway, but I really hate those who do not acknowledge their evil, even though All humanity is evil.<br>A spark that ignites a piece of paper could burn down the entire house.<br><br>What do you think? In all neutrality, I just don&#39;t want to hear anything related to religion or emotion at all, just logic.<br><br>Additional explanation of the conflict:<br>The Jewish point of view:<br>  This is the land of our ancestors, and God promised us it in our Holy Book, and Hitler burned us, so after this torment, we have the right to possess the land that God promised us so that the Savior would come and save us because we are God’s chosen people and the race superior to all.<br>We did not expel the residents or kill them, but rather we only bought lands and we have proof of papers stamped by our loyal friend, the United Kingdom.<br>Of course, no one was displaced and no one was attacked. The ones who started the war were the Arabs in their attempt to expel the immigrants from God’s land.<br>The ones responsible for displacing the Palestinian people are the Arab armies on the basis that they will return to them later.<br>We are the superior white people who built the earth from a barren desert to what it is now.<br>There is no such thing as the Palestinian people, and Palestine has no historical meaning.<br><br>The Palestinian point of view:<br>Just simple residents who either live in agriculture or are under the mercy of British colonialism. Suddenly, the land was declared by British colonialism as a Jewish state in the name of Israel, and everyone must leave it, and whoever does not leave will be expelled by force.<br>The Jews (the Zionist movement) expelled the Palestinians by force and the ensuing killing, destruction, rape, etc.<br>The United Nations and Britain support Israel and throw some crumbs to the Palestinians in order to preserve their standing before the world.<br>We will not forget our land and we will return to it one day as we left it (some families pass on the keys to their homes to each generation so that they do not forget their homeland).<br>Israel is the reason for the suffering of immigrants.<br>Israel is the greatest evil.<br><br>World view:<br>Who the hell cares?? Our problems are enough for us.<br><br>My own point of view:<br>Well, I&#39;m just a simple human and my point of view will probably not matter to you. Maybe if I had the power of Superman, things would be different (does kryptonite really exist??) Well, maybe it&#39;s better to choose the power of Saitama or Goku 🤔🤔🤔
This lesson starts late in the history of that land. That land was already occupied. At this point I would like to know who was there before, and what occurred when the Israeli moved in.
What can we expect from a people who have suffered almost 80 years of oppression and racism and whose lands are seized by the Zionists, of course the resistance!!<br>Israel is therefore a victim of its victims🤷<br>שיהיה לך יום טוב
Also before the israelites came to Caanan  there were alot of caananite tribes  Amorites , hivites , Girgashites , caananites , Perrizites , Jebusites and the hitties
There is no Palestine, so there are no Palestinians. There was a Palestine, and the Palestinians were the Jews who lived there. Being &quot;Palestinian&quot; is not a race, ethnic, nor religious group, it is merely a geographic designation. The Jews of Palestine were the only people who regularly referred to themselves as Palestinians, and when people outside of Palestine referred to Palestinians they only meant the Jews/Hebrews. Those &quot;Palestinians&quot; changed the name of their bordered region to Israel in 1948, when they declared independence, so now they are Israelis.<br> <br>The people who are now referred to as &quot;Palestinians&quot; may be arab; so fine, I agree they are arabs, If you want to call them something, call them NIMAs (non-Israeli muslim arabs). But they are not Palestinians.<br><br>The adoption of the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; by the non-Israeli arabs who live in Gaza or the west bank cities was purely a public relations stunt to try and pretend that they have some claim to the land that exists west of the Jordan River. They have no ancestral or racial connection to the people who co-existed on that land with the Hebrews of Judea and ancient Israel, but that’s a separate anthropological issue (which is easily proven by any study of Middle East genetic anthropology).<br> <br>If you don’t want to believe me, believe the muslim arab people themselves:<br><br>&quot;There is no such country as Palestine.  Palestine is a term the Zionists invented. . . . Our country was for centuries part of Syria.  Palestine is alien to us...&quot;  (Arab leader to British Peel Commission, 1937)<br><br>&quot;There is no such thing as Palestine in history, absolutely not.&quot;  (Professor Philip Hitti, Arab historian to Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, 1946)<br><br>&quot;It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but southern Syria.&quot;  (Delegate of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations Security Council, 1956)<br><br>“Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity serves only tactical purposes. The founding of a Palestinian state is a new tool in the continuing battle against Israel...”  (Zuheir Muhsin, late Military Department head of the PLO and member of its Executive Council, Dutch daily Trouw, March 1977)<br><br>In February 2014, Sheikh Ahmad Adwan, a Muslim scholar who lives in Jordan, recognized Israel’s historic right to live in the Holy Land on his personal facebook page. He wrote: “I say to those who distort their Lord’s book, the Koran: From where did you bring the name Palestine, you liars, you accursed, when Allah has already named it ‘The Holy Land’ and bequeathed it to the Children of Israel until the Day of Judgment,” the Sheikh stated.”<br><br>Sheik Adwan continued, “There is no such thing as &#39;Palestine&#39; in the Koran. Your demand for the Land of Israel is a falsehood and it constitutes an attack on the Koran, on the Jews and their land. Therefore you won’t succeed, and Allah will fail you and humiliate you, because Allah is the one who will protect them (i.e. the Jews).”<br><br>I&#39;m a native-American because I was born in America, but that doesn&#39;t mean that I can make a legitimate claim to belonging to the Sioux or Cherokee or Maidu tribes. To claim an ancestral right to land in New York so I can open a native-American gambling casino would be a fraud.<br><br>If and when the non-Israeli muslim arabs ever finally decide to create one or two independent nation-states out of Gaza and the non-Israeli west bank cities, the people will most likely not even use the term &quot;Palestine&quot; in their permanent country name(s). Palestine is an English word based upon a Latin word used by the Romans to demean the conquered Judeans (the Jews). The Gazans and west bank arabs will ultimately do what the muslims of India did when their two nations were declared independent – they became Pakistan and Bangladesh. Although the people are Indians they didn&#39;t call their respective countries West India and East-Western India. They chose national names that are relevant to their personal real or imagined heritage. Ceylon and Burma are two good examples of non-muslim countries that followed this naming principal: They changed the names of their countries to Sri Lanka and Myanmar, respectively, and became Sri Lankans and Myanmese. <br> <br>For muslim arabs to call themselves by a humiliating name selected by ‘European infidels’ to demean Jews should, and would, be an embarrassment to them.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m19F4IHTVGc&amp;t=192">3:12</a>  you did not clarify how it became under their rule... sykes picot agreement was a betrayal. It should never have been under british rule. period.
Conviently igores various realities.  The focus on Europe ignores the Jews from Arab lands that make up a large population of Israel after they were kicked out of those nations following the War of Independance.  It also ignores the call by the Arab nations to flee the region during the 1948 war to avoid being caught in the cross-fire.  Similarly recommended actions by the Israelis during this conflict are called war crimes by those opposing Israel today.  Finally, the video acurately outlines the plans from the Oslo Accords but accuses Settlers of causing a problem for building in Area C.
@historyonmaps you have the wrong date for when Roman Empire renamed Judea and called it Palestine - that did not happen until 135 AD/CE, but you have the date as 63 BC.  It was not until well after the death of Jesus Christ that the area was renamed Palestine.  Otherwise seems pretty accurate, but that date is totally wrong and you should correct it.
🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m19F4IHTVGc&amp;t=119">1:59</a>.. people were NOT Jews before Christianity! European s, Armenians, South Asians and East Asians, were all different forms of Paganism, before Christianity came along. Where are you getting this false information?
&quot;most arabs weren&#39;t allowed to return to their homes&quot; (after the 1948 war the arabs launched and lost). <br><br>YOU FORGOT TO MENTION---- 800,000 Jews from arab and north african countries were thrown out of THEIR ancient homelands, settled into israel, and also &quot;weren&#39;t allowed to return to their homes&#39; weird that you left that out.  (hint: not weird at all)
you neglected to mention that 77% of the British Mandate was carved into JORDAN- an arab state. THAT&quot;S why the arabs got a &quot;smaller&quot; % of what is today israel/west bank/gaza- the arabs already got 3/4 of the british mandate!
I thought this is a neutral video for a moment, then as usual, they called the Arabs &quot;terrorists&quot; and whatever the Israelis did it is a violent conflict!
Read in the “Options” Magazine that there are two kinds of solutions for any given problem. One is the properly structured ‘elegant’ solutions which is preferred by academics and the officialdom as this is their bread and butter.  However, at times these well structured solutions keep their ‘elegancy’ but the problem is not addressed at all.  The other is the ‘clumsy’ solutions which lack a structure and elegance.  However, it has been proved that at times ‘clumsy’ solutions  is the best.  Here is one such ‘clumsy’ solution for the be-devilled Palestinian/Israeli  problem. <br><br>The on-going war in Palestine, where Israel keeps pummeling Palestine has become a first rate tragedy for the whole world. It is like a malignant tumor in the process of making not only the Middle East region but the whole body politic of the world to its death throes.  In this developed world with AI and what not this malignant tumor has been festering for the past 100 or so years. Is there no solution for this seemingly unsoluble tragedy.  I as a citizen of the planet, has spent a lot of time contemplating this sickness affecting the whole of humanity.   This is the proposal in its may be simplistic nature. The state of Israel could be statutorily dissolved/dislocated.   Do not take me wrong and I do not advocate the death of a single Israeli or Palestinian for that matter.<br><br>Israel has about 8 million citizens.  Suppose Israel supporting countries led by America which un-equivocally support Israel paying a heavy diplomatic price for that support could take in about 2 Mn Israelis into America and so could large countries like Canada which a huge land mass but no populace, Australia which is more or less the same. Both these huge countries could take in say 1 Mn Israelis each.  In the case of Germany, it has a special a nexus with the world Jewry in part due to it Holocaustian past from which collective ‘guilt’ still emanates.  Germany took in l Mn Syrians in to their country and Syrians are different from Germanic races. Not so, Israel.<br><br>There are other European countries like Portugal, Italy, England, South Africa et.el.   How France; another nexus laced with ‘guilt’ as the Vichy Govt.,deported a large cohort of Jews to crematoriums in Germany. Now, we are almost there. Some could even find citizenship in North Korea; should not be surprised at all. Isralis could send rockets to space more efficiently unlike NK made ones which disintegrates in mid-air. Russia which has a decreasing population problem could accommodate 1 Mn Israeli’s and send them to develop Siberia or revamp the Wagner cohort.  Even Iceland could accommodate Isralei Jews and send the down to places where volcanoes erupt so as to deal with them. <br><br>So what of the now emptied state of Israel, which is now no more. Muslims all over the world would be salivating at that prospect and these lands could be turned over to the long suffering Palestinians who would be happy to re-occupy the lands they lost in the creation of Israel.  I conclude and would be happy to elaborate re my ‘brain child’ to anyone who is interested in a ‘win’ ‘win’ situation for all the stakeholders.
Who else is here because of school
People here because of school<br>👇
Jews where killed in the masses and we expect them to back down over another holocaust to push them out? They should go elsewhere? Where? Here? No.
This land belongs to the jews according to all historical sources available 🇮🇱❤️

There have been 1,200 views in 3-months, but there are 27,608 comments?                                     Something wicked this way comes!  lol
It was Islamic issue then was down graded to be Arabic, then Palestinian then now Gaza and West Bank or “Hamas-Stan”. But Hamas flipped the situation to make it international, gradually. I think What is called Israel state is losing, for long term.
Its really obvious when someone is biased
Long live Israel!
So there&#39;s no palestine state up to this day
Prove me wrong on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m19F4IHTVGc&amp;t=510">8:30</a>min that Israel owns Judea and Samaria since you guys refer to as &quot;occupied West Bank&quot;. It means Israel owns it.
The sixty day war? Seriously just delete this video, do more research, and then re-do it.
This video is full of lies and misinformation, and not supported with historical facts <br>Totally biased
Who support Palestinian<br>👇
Call of God is an intersting place to start. I would have called it the conquest of the Caanaites myself. But that is just scripture right?

Listen to the History channel allot, do you?😐
this video sound very professional at the beginning, but it has some glitches in recent history.<br>first of course is the 6 days war, which was 6 and not 60, but then it start to take the arab nerrative - the 2&#39;d intifada supposedly started because ariel sharon visit to the holy places in Jerusalem, only I know for a fact that the fighting started a month before that (it was not acknowledged , but you can see Israeli soldiers killed a week and 2 weeks before..)  <br>also - the retreet of Israel from Gaza was supposed to be the first step for the 2 states solution - Israel generously gave the Palestinians full control over the Gaza strip , even forcing Israelis to leave their homes (which was freed of Egyptian occupation in 67) - Gaza was given free country with all the option to start assuming the dream of free Palestine, But as Hamas took charge it started to attack Israel, and so Israel had to close the border to try to stop buying weapons - It was never a full blockade, just for weapons, but apparently as we see today, a big failure as the Hamas succeeded in building  a monstrous infrastructure of tunnel with unbelievable amount of rockets and other ammunition .<br>Another inaccurate point is saying in 1948 the refugees were the natives residents of the land - some of them actually were, but many were people that came to work in the prosperous Israeli parts of Palestine from neighboring countries. many of the Muslim and Christian Palestinians stayed in their homes at 1948, and so they became citizens of Israel and kept their lands intact. they are now more than 20% of Israelis citizens, and are equal in all
It’s ridiculous, imagine if UK said all countries that once was in the british empire’s rule have to be returned to me, it’s ridiculous, houses get new homeowners and old owners are no longer owners and they can’t just knock on the door and get the new homeowners out
Not a great video, very one sided history here and the narrator mis pronounced almost every name of a place or person
I mean , what about all the people the terror the tragedy that happened to Palestinians, It’s a Palestinian land it’s Palestine and should back to its owners, and jews can live in it as they did before <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23free_palestine">#free_Palestine</a>
gorvenance is a new spelling and why is he calling it the 60-day war?
Completely incorrect propaganda pushed by the Israeli lobby. Israel is a settler colonial population founded in the ruins and bodies of the Palestinian land and nation.
This ignores the Bajillion 2 state solutions offered to the Palestinians where Israel was willing to give them more land than they had for themselves and recognizes Palestine at times when it didn&#39;t exist,  but otherwise, it&#39;s very informative.
People who say free Palestine i have to say israel had that land wayy before Palestine was a thing
In these paragraphs, I will be going over my views and actual facts. <br>!!I AM NOT INTENDING FOR THIS TO OFFEND ANYONE AND IF ANY HURTFUL THINGS ARE GOING TO BE COMMENTED DO NOT COMMENT THEM. I AM WRITING THIS TO GIVE PEOPLE DIFFERENT VIEWS BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO COME INTO CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS OPEN MINDED AND PATIENT!!<br>(I did not cover everything that was talked about in this video)<br> First, lets start with Quran Chapter 17 Al-Isra ayahs 1 and 5-7<br><br>(1) And we gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel (saying): &#39;&#39;Take not other than me as your Wakil (Protector, Lord, Disposer of your affairs). (2) O offspring of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh (Noah)! Verily, he was a grateful slave. (3) And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture, indeed you would do mischief in land twice and you will become tyrants and extremely arrogant!<br> (5) Then We gave you, a return of victory over them. And we helped you with wealth and children and made you more numerous in manpower. (6) (And We said): &#39;&#39;If you do good, you do good for your ownselves.&#39;&#39; Then when the second promise came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces and enter the mosque (of Jerusalem) as they had entered it before, and to destroy with utter destruction all that fell into their hands, (7) [And We said in the Taurat (Torah)] &#39;&#39;It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you, but if you return (to sins), We shall return (to Our Punishment). <br><br><br>Yakub or Jacob, was renamed to Israel which means “one who prevails with God” because he was faithful the Lord gave him this special name. This chapter of the Quran is a very very clear warning to Yakub&#39;s children (the Children of Israel). As I have seen on social media, a lot of Israeli&#39;s are proud about murdering the children. As I have seen they have become very arrogant and ignorant. <br><br>Another group that is also apart of this history are the khazar&#39;s- people of Turkic descent who  in the 8th century according to textual witnesses, accepted Judaism By the beginning of the 7th century, the Khazar&#39;s had become independent of the Turkic empire to the east. But by the middle of that century, the expanding empire of the Arabs had penetrated as far northward as the northern Caucasus, and from then on until the mid-8th century the Khazar&#39;s engaged in a series of wars with the Arab empire.<br><br>When the Arabs and Islam was mentioned it felt like the view on them was slightly hateful, but that&#39;s just my opinion.  <br><br>The Ottoman empire was not an &#39;&#39;Islamic superpower&#39;&#39;. It may feel like that because of the leader and the flag but it was never mentioned in the Quran and has nothing to do with Islam. We should actually use white, red, green, black and yellow which was mentioned in a hadith, to represent Islam. <br><br>Maybe, just maybe, the british people managing everything were maybe possibly slightly Islamophobic or didn&#39;t like Arabs and they could&#39;ve been more in favor of the Israeli people which made the Palestinians upset.<br><br>I think the way parents also push things onto their kids can contribute to the hatred. My school nurse told me that way way way back when she was in school they had such fear of the Russians and that they were going to bomb America. They used to have drills where they would hide under their desks incase of an attack. I know that growing up whenever I would see Jews anywhere I would always look at them differently and not really like them and I never knew why.<br><br>(there is so many more things I have to say but I keep losing my train of thought and I apologize for that)<br><br>Since I have a lot of years ahead of me I should not be stressing about this but since I am aware of what&#39;s happening I have a responsibility to share the knowledge I have. I recommend that everyone reading this does research on the khazar&#39;s and explores deeper into this subject. I am against any lives being taken but was Israel is doing is simply unacceptable. The things that are also coming out of the Israelis mouths&#39; are simply disgusting and it breaks my heart that we, as a community can protest and fight against so many other things but a ton of people are staying silent about this. Gaza is being wiped out as we speak with one side already being completely demolished. We can no longer stay neutral in this situation and we must come together and help the Palestinian people. I really really recommend checking out the instagram page, Eye on Palestine. The content they post really gives you a visual on what is happening in Palestine. I hope everyone reading this has a blessed day, FREE PALESTINE!!<br>( I AM NOT SAYING ALL ISRAELIS ARE BAD AND ALL PALESTINIANS ARE GOOD, THESE ARE JUST MY THOUGHTS AND I TRULY BELIEVE IT&#39;S JUST THE GOVERNMENT )
The narrator is a complete goofball.  How could he possibly make that mistake!
The 6-days war is mistakenly called 60-days war in this video. Twice!
The Jews have seem to forgotten that being Jewish is not a nationality it’s a religion. These people got the nerve
Very informative!
What kind of app or software you use to create this kind of video?
Palestine is a country,  NOT a state
These commentators r 100℅ bias against Isreal. The commentators did not mention d reason why Isreal was created. These commentators r clearly anti-shemetic   n can not b accepted..... Not at all balanced
It&#39;s a false descriptor. It wasn&#39;t &quot;Palestinian land&quot;. That descriptor evolved much later.
the scripture describes the british greed for gold, lust for war because they get little girls out of it of those area they raid
So Britain and the UN played a huge part in the conflict that is now today Israel and Palestine.

I believe it was the head of the CIA in the 50s that said, we will know our propaganda has worked when everything the American people is a lie.
Well said 👍 About bloody time this was run up the flagpole 😬 because nobody, from the general public to government, neither learns history nor respects history, particularly if negative to their entrenched beliefs 😡 This was a total stitch-up of all Arab nations for which we are now suffering the consequences!<br><br>There&#39;s an in depth, free documentary, on the YouTube Free Documentsry - History, channel, which is a must. &quot;How Britain Started the Arab-Israeli Conflict&quot;, 52.5 minutes.

In a theatre every one applauds when the Hero takes revenge for his beloved, but in real life people choose the villian no matter what he does to provoke the hero.

but am I the only one laughing hysterically when you think that this story is written by two Austrians who have a surname that starts with H? crazy. all a gigantic madness 😢
THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS ANTISEMITIC VIDEO.. <br>1) PALESTINE WASN&#39;T  A THING  IN THAT TIME LINE ! <br>YOU WELCOME 🙏  DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK
Thank you for the history lesson.  I have never really understood the series of events that led to all of the conflict.  I suspect however, that its genesis pre-dates 1917 by a thousand years or so.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s so impossible to choose a villain and a victim.  I think we need to find a win-win solution for the current reality rather than try to right the wrongs of the past.  Because how far back do you go?  But I am completely ignorant of the history and have much to learn.  Thanks for getting me on the path to understanding.  🙏🏻

Usually when someone loses a war they have to give territories they invaded back... I don&#39;t get why the people of Palestine had to give up land instead of Germany
The real problem is that Palestine is the land of 3 religions, but Israel only wants 1

And the LORD said to Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now your eyes, and look from the place where you are northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: For all the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to your seed FOREVER. Genesis 13:14-15 God said this to Abraham in the 18th century b.c. In 1400 b.c. Joshua and the Jews moved into their land. Jews have lived there ever since. They were never completely eliminated from the land. The Assyrians and the Babylonians took control of it, then Cyrus the Persian allowed them to rebuild the temple which the Romans later destroyed. The Romans scattered the Jews and emperor Hadrian renamed Israel Palestine. 2000 years later they were allowed to go back to their own land and call it Israel. That&#39;s how Israel was created. It was an act of God!
It was the rothschilds that created israel.
The british didnt promised those borders in the thumbnail.  They merely offered it to both sides.  The arabs rejected those borders.
I started this video thinking it was an uneducated surface level reading.  Here at the end I believe it is actually a malicious lie.  Well right at first you leave out the ottomans struck first.  British imperialism doesnt come into it.  They were left with the area after the end of the war and were eager to lose it.  If anything they left too soon.  I could go on for a while with innacuracies in this video.  Also they are all palestinians.  It isnt palestinians and zionists.  Its Jews, Arabs and syrians.  Palestinian nationalism wouldnt come later.  the muslims in the region named themselves after the region.
Israel belongs to the Jewish people, it has been so, for over 3 thousand years...the heading of this video should actually be &quot; How Palestine Was Created&quot;...the info in this video is absolutely incorrect...Read the history for yourself, dates back to the roman Emporer, Hadrid and other empires who tried to take over Israel, and how many Jews were scattered around the world because of empires invading their land
Another Austrian ? <br>Crazy country .
Completely it,s failure of British injusticefied policy worked every where in philisteen to stablish zeonisom in land of philisteen.over all British is the main gambler of this conflict.
Rothschild
Next time I go back in time I&#39;ll take care of Theodor Herzl but nobody will even know as this video won&#39;t exist after I&#39;m done, we&#39;ll just have peace in the Middle East, aren&#39;t time paradoxes are fun?
Can you name me the year palestine was founded and it&#39;s first president?
knowing the history. the objective by the Brits and the Yanks is crystal clear. Drive a wedge deep into Muslim territory and create conflict to benefit off. Mayve even steal all their resources.
I&#39;m Jewish, but thi is Palestinian land.
Biased and false
fight for desertttt that we left 10,000 years ago when the israelites went to egpyt. It really doesnt make any sense to me
so where should Jews then?
Britain gave the issue to the UN who handled it. The UN is responsible.
How evil
The most ancient Christian communities have existed in Palestine long before Islam was even conjured.
This is horrific but its a thousand times worse than the sheeple can imagine. 9
Those of us from Europe and the Middle East already knew this, Americans are only learning about it now
There was never a country named Palestine
This is a bloody mess not of the Jews or Palestinians making. And the world is now drawn into an impossible situation that sees no apparent resolution.
How many times in history a country without any hands on knowledge in another country, dictate its future?
Zahir Muhsein was a Palestinian leader of the pro-Syria As-Sa&#39;iqa Ba&#39;athist faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization between 1971 and 1979.<br>In an interview with Trouw Magazine, 31. March 1977 he stated.....&quot;The Palestinian people do not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct &quot;Palestinian people&quot; to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons. The establishment of a Palestinian state is a new tool to continue the fight against Israel and for Arab unity.<br><br>Hamas Minister of the Interior and of National Security Fathi Hammad, aired by Al-Hekma TV on March 23, 2012. Stated.....<br>.....we all have Arab roots, and every Palestinian, in Gaza and throughout Palestine, can prove his Arab roots - whether from Saudi Arabia, from Yemen, or anywhere. We have blood ties.  Personally, half my family is Egyptian. We are all like that. More than 30 families in the Gaza Strip are called Al-Masri [&quot;Egyptian&quot;]. Brothers, half of the Palestinians are Egyptians and the other half are Saudis. Who are the Palestinians? We have many families called Al-Masri, whose roots are Egyptian. Egyptian! They may be from Alexandria, from Cairo, from Dumietta, from the North, from Aswan, from Upper Egypt. We are Egyptians. We are Arabs.<br><br>Salma Fayumi, a resident of Kafr Qasim (Palestin/Israel), demonstrated her cooking prowess on the show &quot;Master Chef.&quot; Fayumi proudly showed off her Kushari dish that she prepared, &quot;Egyptian cuisine made of rice and lentil.&quot; &quot;My family came from Egypt, from Faiyum, and I am Salma Fayumi from Faiyum,&quot; the cook from Kafr Qasim said.
I would agree that 1947 and 1948 were critical years, but you&#39;ve left out that Jews were massacred in those years as well. The Palestinians did not, and have not, ever wanted a Jewish state. The 1948 war was launched by 5 Arab states. As far as a historical claim to the land, the Roman - Jewish wars were fought on this land in the first century. Jews have fought and lived on this land for a very long time.
A totally stupid thing to do!🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇵🇸🍉
Not exactly a very balanced interpretation of history….
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6foH3Zc82ZQ&amp;t=236">3:56</a><br>yes Jesus (peace be upon him) is coming back on the second return too those devils in this so called &quot;Israel&quot; and all the people who support Israel state will fear him and they even will die out of fear, because Jesus(peace be upon him) will come with army of angels, what your mere human&#39;s power will do in front of angel?
Some of us are aware and talk about it.  But we need a lot higher awareness! <br><br>Palestine will be free and there will be restorative justice for Palestinian people.
I think blaming the British is very simplistic, a lot of other countries grabbed land and they didn&#39;t do anything at the UN either, let&#39;s not turn a blind eye to the complicity of other nations
Israel was there before
Zionists will say that this is propaganda and never happened.
So basically the Jews became the new Nazis??
The amount of bots in the comments trying to twist the truth
The mistake was the intial territory carve up on a map. Why not just divide into north and south? It was a disaster from the start
How did the people in Palestine become Muslims;m? The answer is’Jihad’. What happened to all the Christians, Jews and Baal worshippers who lived in Palestine and the entire region? They were forcefully converted to Islam under duress. Some Muslims today are descendants of Jews and Christians. Israel is a good idea. Why should everyone in a particular region of the world be forced to practice one religion?
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Thr jews killed british soldiers.and niw were helping them disgracefull.
Be aware, this is propaganda not history. There&#39;s so much carefully left out. And even mischaracterzes the territory as a country. In fact the Arabs of the region, who only started being called Palestinians in the 1960s for propaganda purposes, didn&#39;t consider themselves one nation, and their allegiances were never to some nonexistent country called Palestine.<br><br>They talk about reprisals, but not the horrific massacres that brought them.<br><br>And &quot;their historic homeland&quot; again pretends it was a country.<br><br>If it was such a vicious, relentless ethnic cleansing, how are there today two million Israeli Arabs?
FOR STARTERS,3000 YEARS AGO ISRAEL ALREADY EXISTED,INFO HERE IS B........ZZZZZZ
😂😂😂Israel was created by King David among others🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
And palstine is yhe Victor howvis that fair
Concerning the white paper you skipped though, with a few bombed places, it was not a few, it was The Irgun, later the Lehi Militant Group aka the stern gang. (Wikipedia)  who admitted  they were terrorists.
not correct
What exactly were they fleeing from again?
There&#39;s something i don&#39;t understand. In the video he says palestinians all rejected UN&#39;s plan, to mark of 55% of the country for a jewish state, but the zionist agree, in order to get rid of the british. So they went through with the plan, without the acceptance of the palestinians?
Al-Quran explains everything<br><br>Al isra - 4<br>&quot;And We warned the Children of Israel in the Scripture, “You will certainly cause corruption in the land twice, and you will become extremely arrogant&quot;
we Somalis  🇸🇴  we stand with Palestine.
So much fake misinformation in this video. In 1948 the surrounding arab states invaded israel.... Israel didn&#39;t start wiping out Palestinians as soon as the Brits left... this is such a well documented event... the Arabs didn&#39;t accept the partition plan... the Jews did
When your land have to give to jewish wtf
through lies... Many places named after Israel true masters,  The Rothschild&#39;s..
Nasty history of Britain that they want people to forget!
but there were no palestinians then. the arabs wanted a pan arab state and even today, the arabs in refugee camps in jordan, syria, egypt etc who are called palestinian refugees are not supported by their arab friends who....oh why bother
I love jews thank west for their existence <br>Running organizations like open diaolog or open borders that brings and welxome all migrants also thank for fighiting against hate speach for us thank jewish
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6foH3Zc82ZQ&amp;t=415">6:55</a> Spoiler they didn&#39;t because the Arabs rejected the offer and a Jewish state. 20% of the population is Palestinians in Israel and experience rights as a normal Jew would. Arabs weren&#39;t forced to leave; they left themselves. Stop lying to yourself.
So the Rothschild family bought a bad stock (genocide). Can’t win them all I guess as Buffett said…
How much did they get paid
AWESOME! TRUTH crushed to the ground is rising.<br><br> This video sufficiently explains why modern day Israel is not Israel of the Bible. <br><br>Modern Day &quot;so called Israel&quot; was stolen from Palestine spearheaded by evil European looters and colonizers. <br><br>I won&#39;t even start on the raping of Africa. <br><br>Thanks for sharing your epic work 💯💯<br><br>And as a Christian, I do NOT stand with modern day fake Israel.
The way Israel was created, is the textbook example of how to wage an endless war.
It wasn&#39;t only the Jews immigrating to Palestine. Under the British Mandate, the Arab population of Palestine increased from 660,000 in 1922 to 1,300,000 in 1947, much of which was economic immigration created by Jewish development. <br><br>And, yes it&#39;s true that Jews had only acquired 8% of Palestine; however, Arabs also only owned 8%; the rest was state lands.
The real jews are of Jacob&#39;s seed, they are the negros from the tribe of Judah.
I thought Britain or England was 7-800 years old,<br>not 3100 years old?
This makes me feel like the very ground under foot smells like death. Its horrible to human life. The solution now seems impossible. Why that little strip of land and so much agony? &quot;The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens&quot;<br>Baha&#39;u&#39;llah
The term &quot;Palestine&quot; gained prominence after the Roman Emperor Hadrian&#39;s actions in the 2nd century CE. After suppressing the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-136 CE), Hadrian renamed the region &quot;Syria Palaestina&quot; as a way to erase Jewish identity and connection to the land. The name was a reference to the Philistines, ancient inhabitants of the coastal region.
It&#39;s unbelievable videos explaining about &quot;How Israel was Created&quot; don&#39;t mention where the NAME Israel came from. Nor tells who were the people who built the city. Who were all the first several Kings in Israel, and Don&#39;t tell WHO were the INVADERS on that land.  yep...the video above just tell the little tip of the iceberg. and BTW, the vid says the &quot;British&quot; did this, but doesn&#39;t EVEN mention why the British did that.
This is by far the most inaccurate depiction of what really happened.  There was no country of Palestine.  This is full of lies and inaccurate information. It is completely the leftist Arab view.
Regarded as a Miracle development, the creation of a Jewish state seemingly the one responsible is irrelevant?
So Britain and the UN played a huge part in the conflict that is now today Israel and Palestine.
Video fails to mention the pogroms by the local Arab population. Here&#39;s a list.<br>A few more:<br><br><b>Jerusalem Pogrom (1834):*</b> During the Peasants&#39; Revolt against Egyptian rule, there were violent incidents in Jerusalem that affected different communities.<br><br><b>Petah Tikva (1878):*</b> A Jewish settlement, Petah Tikva, was attacked during the late 19th century. This was part of a series of violent incidents related to tensions between Jewish and Arab communities.<br><br> Safed Pogrom (1834):** Anti-Jewish violence occurred in the town of Safed during the Peasants&#39; Revolt against Egyptian rule.<br><br>Safed Pogrom (1838):** Following the Damascus Affair in 1840, there were anti-Jewish riots in Safed and other areas, resulting in violence against the Jewish community.<br><br><br><b>Tiberias Pogrom (1834):*</b> Tiberias experienced violence during the Peasants&#39; Revolt against Egyptian rule, impacting various communities.<br><br><b>*Hebron Pogrom (1834):*</b> Hebron also faced violence during the Peasants&#39; Revolt, affecting the Jewish and Christian communities.<br><br><br><b>Safed Pogrom (1840):*</b> Tensions rose in Safed following the Damascus Affair, leading to anti-Jewish riots and violence against the Jewish population.<br><br>Jaffa Riots (1876):** A series of disturbances occurred in Jaffa, involving clashes between Muslims and Jews<br><br>Jaffa Riots (1921):** Arab-Jewish tensions escalated, leading to violence and casualties in the city of Jaffa.<br><br>1929 Hebron Masacre <br><br>Arab Riots (1936-1939):** A series of Arab uprisings against British rule and Jewish immigration, leading to clashes between Arabs and Jews.
During this period. Jordan was carved out of Mandatory Palestine. Pakistan was created with massive civilian losses in the millions and huge displacement of people.<br>Syria/Iraq/Lebanon was carved out of the French Mandates. And no outrage. I wonder why.... Could it be Israel was the only and only Jewish State. And based on Jews being such a minority in the world virtually impossible for them to be the majority anywhere when living under another groups Government.
Sadly this video is flawed from the beginning by suggesting Palestine was a country as opposed to an area land controlled by various powers. Most recently the Ottoman and then the British. It was not a country. There was no &#39;Palestinian leader.&#39; And in general Jews called themselves Palestinian. The local Muslim population identified as Arab until primarily 1964
Fake news 😂😂
The British messed up a lot of stuff.
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸
I blame the Brits and the Americans; even the charismatic T E Lawrence sold out his Arab buddies….typical imperialist.
bro just decided to edit history 💀💀💀💀💀💀
&quot;Why were the British making promises about other peoples&#39; countries?&quot;<br><br>Palestine had never been a sovereign nation in all of human history.  It had only ever been part of larger empires.  The last being the British.  So it was theirs to do with as they pleased.  The territory of Palestine ceased to exist in 1947.
So, in other words, it&#39;s too late to give Palestine back. And we&#39;re all forced to see the extinction of Palestinians and western governments just going to sit here and let it happen.
Please start the story on the relationship between ottoman and palestine and its residents. Just to know about the people of ancient roots and the people brought by the ottoman imperialism.  It is obvious that there were no jews in palestine because they were chased off and scattered around the world.<br>Otherwise, this in only the story of balfour declaration and zionisims as solution for anti semitism (the plan, execution, and effect).
Stop with this propaganda.
The state if isreal recently formed. Israelites bee there tousands of years

Hamas attacked expecting Israel to retaliate so that they can get more funding..its really that simple.
We indians love Israel coz we don&#39;t want Muslim to live on this earth as their destination has already planned in Quran they want Jannah n we will make sure every Muslim should reach there So Israel is working hard to send them in Jannah and we Indians are with Israel
This guy is meandering the topic instead of speaking to the point. Even if hamas is using shelter in between palestinians, how to differentiate who is hamas and who is palestine. Palestine is allowing hamas to shelter in their home and this is what they are not acceptable.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=901">15:01</a> The Sanhedrin…<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=913">15:13</a> I want to clarify that this part isn’t actually true because I’m a Christian &amp; we have never condemned Israel for Jesus’ crucifixion. Doesn’t matter which political party/Rome/Sanhedrin was gave the final nod because our ultimate belief is that that was God’s plan. After all we ardently follow (or atleast keep trying to) the words of Jesus’ disciples who were all Jewish.. we love &amp; read Paul’s epistles to churches who would’ve eventually become part of the Sanhedrin if he hadn’t encountered Christ on his way to Damascus.. <br><br>In fact Israel &amp; all the Jews among other things are always included in our prayers every Sunday in church. <br><br>I have been to Israel, Egypt &amp; Jordan along with my family &amp; a huge group of about 100 Christian people who went to visit the Holy Land &amp; not once was it because we hated the Jews. We technically can’t hate Jews or consider them God killer without hating Jesus (anyway Jesus wouldn’t be God if he could’ve been actually killed by humans right?!).<br><br>In fact, Christians have always supported Israel because of Jesus. Many Christians live peacefully in Israel. My uncle who is a tour agent mainly conducting Israel tours has many Jewish friends &amp; he adores them. To be honest, we look at Israel with awe &amp; adoration &amp; pray for their peace in our prayers. <br><br>Frankly this is the first time I’ve heard the term ‘God killer’ used in our context because we don’t see it that way at all… couldn’t be further away from the truth 😅😂<br><br>This is the average Protestant perspective today.. can’t speak for Roman Catholics because I’ve never attended their mass but I believe they don’t hate Jews either because my catholic friends all support Israel…<br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=1394">23:14</a> so true about this part… feels like we’ve lost the art of thinking deeply &amp; actually fact checking &amp; getting engaging in a long meaningful conversation these days.. people don’t really look at all perspectives &amp; sides of any issue before blindly making up their minds…<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=1717">28:37</a> The Palestinian people voted in Hamas &amp; then Hamas went &amp; killed all the political members of other parties that were contending in the elections &amp; never held elections after that… Palestinians have been paying for that mistake ever since unfortunately…<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=2055">34:15</a> so eloquently put 😂💯<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=3247">54:07</a> 100% true..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=144">2:24</a> he is saying his podcast is genuine 😂😂and the bald person is what ma political science and they are misinformed by i dont know who i am gonna say is dont believe this bakchods who will say anything to get views just do your research guys its very easy then come to a conclusion ..they dont know what they are saying  just making people fool ..with there bakchodis
When the war started I said in a comment that Israel will kill 100k people.. Muslims are 2 billion and Jews are 30 million, Israel&#39;s math is very good..
half of the things he blabbered were false news spread by israel
America, Europe, India, Japan are suffering from peaceful community. The point is The whole world is suffering from peaceful community and The whole World can&#39;t be wrong right!<br>And I support Israel Not because they are Jews, but Returning the favour. They supported us during our hard times and we as Indians should also support them during their hard times.
INDIANS realise Israeli Defence Force is the world&#39;s Terrorists. <br>Isreal is stealing lying killing Palestinians to steal their land. If u want a Hindu India, why do u have synagogues?
if you can call Andrew Tate on this podcast and debate on it the same with him.
&quot; Pro palestine doesnt mean pro hamas or pro terror&quot; He is just so on point🙌
Those who support Palestine support’s Terrorist (Hamas)
There is propaganda from both sides and lies. Not just isreal
If u havnt got the balls to have a opinion then keep ur mouth shut. Uts simple as that . Pandering to islamofascits its not gonna to be good.
Iska information totally wrong
Wow!!! I found clarity. Thank you❤
Okay! All he is talking about is, how to protect oneself from Israel attack, and Hamas not letting Israel demolish Gazan houses. <br>But, not a single mention of the treatment of a normal Palestinian in Israel - apartheid Israeli regime.<br>October 7 was the break of tolerance of this apartheid system, and Israel’s swift actions to deny muslims to al aqsa mosque and invade Jerusalem completely.
More pro gym
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=2365">39:25</a> which incident is that ❓
Can anyone please clear my doubt what is right wing and left wing<br>As much I know right are pro rich ,open market, liberalism, less gov intervention, capitalist<br>Left are pro poor, socialist
Israel and Palestine is the best example of the &quot;young will forget and the old will die&quot; and where was mitra ji during the 1948 &quot;nakba&quot; and don&#39;t give me that bullshit that the Arabs attacked  Israel first. How in the absolute shit would someone accept a UN Resolution of giving up more than half of their land to some so called refugees from Europe just because they wanted it. The idea that&#39;s history is a pretty much useless subject when you can just google it and acquire the information you want to is complete bullshit. YOU SHOULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR OWN HISTORY THROUGH RELIABLE SOURCES BECAUSE WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT IT CANNOT BE CHANGED BUT THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES WHERE HISTORY IS FALSELY MANIPULATED. Hitler did that in Germany and now the Zionist are doing it again by attempting to manipulate the history of Palestine before 1948. They are using the same strategy that the Nazis used against them &quot;If you tell a lie and you keep telling it long enough then people would believe you&quot;by Joseph Goebbels
I would have liked if the host didn’t keep repeating “lot of pro-Palestinians people…”. You repeated yourself too many times. <br>AIM as always 👌🏼👌🏼
There is no better way to understand things and that is to learn about the history of this situation and realize that good always wins♥️🙏🏾🇮🇱
These are the words of a person who is involving religion and supporting 🇮🇱 rather then taking a humanitarian perspective
He still feels that Isr-Palestian war is hindu-muslim war and not a political war😂
What a story😂
Very bias opinions! 👎
Please both leaders come together and solve the problem beacuse so many people and so many small girls and boys are dying in this war please please stop all this beacuse you both leaders are waiting Lost of Money and your peace of mind of all the people of your both countries and all over the World i will pray for you all beacuse everything is created by GOD and after we are going to go to him only so I just want to let know that we all to leave in peace what will remain only ASH and so many will die without GODS wish as he has created us all if I have written anything wrong please I am sorry.
What is the non sense he is saying? I have never seen such brainless propaganda
Who the hell are you RSS chaddi. Tu ye bol raha hamne jaise angrezo se jaise maafi mangi thi waise mangle
Your family torturing from 70years in your home. What do you respond?
I think Ranveer somehow confuses being neutral with not siding with the correct side. you are so scared of public opinion that you can&#39;t even blame the terrorists. Good job
Bhai Pro Palestine ko laana podcast mai.
Sab root cause ye bhadwe British logo ka hai. Har jagah Puri duniya mai gandagi karke bhaith gaye hai.
Pls do purvapaksha
&quot;The average palestinian isn&#39;t hamas&quot;. Oh please!! They are very much hamas. You ARE what you elect. There&#39;s video footage of palestinians in westbank celebrating hamas attacks. When it comes to this community they are all the same. They will never stop spewing venom against the &quot;kafirs&quot;. Israel shouldn&#39;t even be giving 10 seconds. How many minutes did muslims give to Kashmiri Hindus?
Call him again!!
This man just pro Israeli propaganda
How do u know ur friend was killed by Hamas when Israel killed their own at the festival
Those who support Israel go educate your self about this history of conflict. Or assume that some people came to your house as a guest then start proclaiming that this house belongs to them and kicked you out from your own house how would be your feelings that time? In that point if you take action to take back your house from them is there any wrong about that? It’s that terrorism.
Have a guy who is not super pro-Israel next time. Good to hear this perspective, but even i could counter some of his points.
You used a Sudanese flag on the title card, not Palestinian<br>FREE PALESTINE! 🇵🇸🇵🇸
This guy seems to be anti BJP from his recent podcasts.....
Muslims alway supports muslims . period.
I leave this podcast as a more informed citizen. I would actually love to see a part three!! Thank so much Ranveer for this !
@BeerBiceps Ranveer may be get Mohammed Zubair or someone like him who are used to feeding one sided blinded false narratives, as i am sure he would be blind hamas supporter, so we can have  a 3 way conversation.
Pro Israel = no soul
I am Hindu and I don&#39;t care about any religion but about HUMANITY and PEACE. <br><br>We are being on the wrong side of history. There have been severe displacement amd ethnic cleansing happening in Gaza.<br>Let me remind you one thing. Gaza is so small like you could walk from it&#39;s one end to the other within a short period of time. Israel is one of the most powerful military force. If Hamas is hiding under the city of Gaza why the Israel is bombarding the whole Palestine without doing proper military operation to exterminate the Hamas? Plus why don&#39;t they have enough information about the Hamas? They have let out the names of Hamas people like Sunday, Monday, Tuesday... Man, what?<br><br>What happening to Gaza is not a war. It&#39;s pure ethnic cleansing. A war is when two equal forces fight. In this scenario one has massive armed strength while other has not.<br><br>In addition to all of this why did they attacked all the hospitals, killed journalists and cut out all necessary supplies of Palestinian people?<br>Moreover all statements of Israel have been a line drawn on water when it was exposed that 40 children who were claimed to be killed by Hamas was actually the children from Gaza trafficked by Israeli militia.<br><br>If we are supporting Israel for the sake of what they have done to us in past consider our past situation of being colonized India. We fought to overthrow the British from our land. Same goes for Palestine. If they are doing wrong we are also wrongdoers.<br><br>For your information Israel is not only messing up with Gaza but also with five other countries like Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. Bombarding five countries and playing victim all the time does not seem right.<br><br><br>Supporting Palestine doesn&#39;t mean supporting Hamas but supporting peace and humanity. The political propaganda doesn&#39;t cover any humanitarian concerns. From the river to the sea Palestine should be free 🤍
When shkushinchutsu of wokism completes, the estrogen packs look like abhijit liar shitra 😂..future mirror for transgender boy ranveeraaa
Very neatly put. Can you explain in the context of case Lodged against in International court of justice and what would be the expected judgement OF  ICJ
wow, just found this channel. a very informative and thought-provoking discussion.
God Bless &amp; Protect Israel ❤
Abhijeet, you&#39;re missing the point here. Israeli&#39;s have occupied Palestinian land and they are living on their own land as slaves. When they fight back, people like you call them terrorists. By these standards you&#39;ll call our hero Bhagat Singh a terrorist too when he went against the Brits, the then occupiers of India.<br><br>For context, I am not a Muslim. I am as Hindu and an Indian nationalist as they come. And not all Hindus support this theory of Israel defending itself. They are the occupiers and trying to play the victim.
Talking crap here won’t make this man knowledgeable he is just spewing his own narrative. If anyone comes with demolition orders from a government who is partial in nature towards the Palestinians while the Palestinians holds the legal documents to that house it’s called occupying n in the process whr u illegally force the whole family to leave n in the process u shoot a house member isn’t called doing a deal he is here to push a narrative to make Israelis look rightful isn’t he ???
Can’t believe this guy is just repeating raped women n babies killed by HAMAS while these claimed were not backed by evidence by the Israeli army n they themselves refuted the claims that they have no evidence of raped women n killed babies later onn the international television. I mean com’on wat are you feeding to the world ?? You are not listening n covering all the points. This guy has not experienced wat Palestinians are going through to say that the ask them prior to evacuate these are automated msgs which sometimes reach or not and Things were worste for Palestinians even before HAMAS came into being so he is just talking crap here it’s obvious.
This guy needs to know what is jihad to call someone a Jihadi
1500 Israel vs 24000 Palestinians died so I stand with Palestine
Banneya khanzeer
Never trust a community who spends so much on its movies etc, their good actors and full off bs propaganda. Ie - Israel and india
Two gays supporting Israhell 😂😂
I just want to tell ya&#39;ll that I love you guys. Your religion doesn&#39;t matter, race , caste, gender, country etc. I love all of you.
why is he repeating Zionist propaganda? The IDF are literally CARPET BOMBING GAZA. Israel doesn’t have a bloodlust to kill and it hurts their cause if they kill women and children 😂 im sorry?? 🤣 am I hearing this correctly?? Sir, we must be seeing two different realities right now. Gaza is utterly FLATTENED by one of the strongest military in the world funded by the strongest government in the world. Israel has completely lost the information war. They are showing NO REMORSE and will not stop. don’t even talk about cruelty if you can’t address this reality that Gazans are facing. My goodness.
Please invite Elianne El-Amyouni a.k.a twitchy witch!!
They send SMS which you saw but didn&#39;t see any bombings? So what texts were sent then? You contradict yourself that&#39;s what happens when you watch too much bollywood and live a lie😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=1260">21:00</a> what a load of crap palestinian military bases are around the citizens because its a one mile long concentration camp😅😅😅 how can you separate everything. And this guys supposed to be &#39;educated&#39;haha stick too bollywood.<br><br>Booohooo the Muslims screwed you up now your licking balls😅
Netanyahu himself has donated money to Hammas and supported their existence so that he can legitimize the narrative of Palestine as a hostile state and occupy of the West Bank. Netanyahu is an expansionist not a supporter of peace. Do you expect the native people to behave like &quot;&quot;Kill me. Take my whole country. I am Jesus Christ crucify me. I die for the whole world&quot;.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=3092">51:32</a> yeah😢
Funny how The victims of colonialism is supporting a colonial state for colonising a country. HYPOCRISY AT ITS PEAK 👌🏻
So bro chose the countries where wars have been going on for a very long time so when the people of Palestine were being attacked for this many years it was not war and terror but when they were thinking to retaliate they were wrong but when Israel did it. it is justified I am not taking any side I always vote for peace on both sides I don&#39;t want innocent people to die. and there are many videos of Israeli soldiers attacking mosques when people are praying when they give the taste of their own medicine it is wrong
I find the settlements in the West Bank to be an interesting addition to this conversation. Is it possible for you interview a Palestinian living in the West Bank, an Israeli settler and finally an ex IDF soldier who is a part of the “Breaking the Silence” movement?
These are all false things.... Whatsoever he said.!
Again pure right wing argument and perspective,not steelmanning argument. Completely towards islamophobic perspective denying the right to defend.
You know when jews came to Palestinian land they took all cities developed and fertile areas and ground water. They ethnically cleansed Palestinians from their own land.
Jews were gifted Palestinian land by British.
If you want true story about Israel Palestine issue, talk to Ilan pappe or gideon levy or Norman Flinkenstein, who are historians and scholars who are jews and have been talking about the actual history.
Lol Jesus christ was jew?
Free Palestine from hamas 😢😢
Beer batli gives me creepies here for abhijeet iyer
India should stand with righteous not with the one who helped us. Not everyone who helped us are righteous. <br><br><br>🇮🇳🇮🇳 All Indian Muslims ❤ stands with the people of Palestine🇵🇸🇵🇸.  ❤<br><br><br>We don&#39;t care about the majority Hindus who stand with Israel.
I thought he have to complete the homework correctly no to learn for social media
It is very good video
Thank you. This was so refreshing to hear anyone who actually understands what happened &amp; the history &amp; what is going on.🙏🙏🙏🙏
Why don&#39;t you make podcast on manipur??? 😢😢
Anti-muslim
We should learn from muslims... Everywhere london new york Paris south africa ..across the world they rallied to support Palestinians..... Whereas we are fighting among each other in the name of caste....
Free Palestine from Israel and it&#39;s never ever been isreal its called Palestine way before every prophet A.s who came down there every Book which given to them is in the Palestine in torah in bible it&#39;s called Palestine not isreal they are mentioned people to children e of Israel because prophet Yaqoob A.s   second name was Isreal because he is son of Ibrahim A.s
He is only telling shit about that he know why hamas is become hamas why they attack why isreal is doing all this and your telling label Muslims or they sold there soul they did they did for the money you are attacking mocking Palestine...and isreal is not innocent if you are ok with Palestinian children being killed then you have to ok with isreali children hypocrisy is the part of your life you want to accept what you want not the reality.
Haryana when a whole moob attacked the Hindus and murdered, rapes thousands of Hindus during savan month what about that?
Israel have no right to defend as they have occupied others land ,it is like british occupy india and then say we have right to defend
As every day there is genocide of Palestinen  peoples why don&#39;t you recognize IDF as terrorist organization
Todays world israel are Nazis
He forget the ethnic cleaning of muslims of Gujarat ,and all over india ,he forget bagwa terrorrism
It start from 1948 as israel terrorist Jews attack Palestine ,as india belongs to Indian&#39;s ,Palestine belongs to Palestinens
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUE8N74opz0&amp;t=2682">44:42</a>  oh god 90% are good???? Hey Ram yeh log kabhi nahi sudhrenge
It is sad that a great analyst like AIM thinks peacefuls can be logical ... Sir they are not... They can never be one... Because their religion teaches them to be that what they are... Please don&#39;t hogwash the truth... For them their religion is was and will be everything.... Arre they don&#39;t have empathy for their own wife or a under age daughter... Stop sympathizing wife beaters and daughter sellers... <br>IT IS WHAT IT IS
What happened to Rabbi&#39;s wife?? 😢😢😢
I support Israel fully , palestine is a terrorist country , but on the part of Hitler this guy has read US version of history and watched a lot of Netflix.
Your a joke
God bless Isreal ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks for watching, look out for part 2 coming soon!<br><br>Please remember to be polite in the comments. Any comments that we consider to be offensive or aggressive will be removed.
The &#39;conflict&#39; goes back much further than tge British rule period
Historically <br>Romans named Israel Palestine<br>The true owner of that lsnd is Israel <br>Historically
It was false to say that most Jews were not Zionists at any point just because they did not want to move to the ancestral land. To be a zionist one simply has to acknowledge that the Jewish people have a right to self determination in their ancestral homeland. I would submit that 99% of Jews at that time were Zionists
No word about  &quot; Amin al-Husaini &quot; , this is a one side story.....
The British governments can never be trusted, it was the same then and it&#39;s the same today.
This is a great summary from a British colonial perspective.  I highly recommend both parts 1 &amp; 2.
What everyone miss to mention is that Jordan was part of the british mandate for palestine, so the arabs took 3 times more land than the jews, actually the so called &quot;palestinan&quot; arabs have a state since 1947, it is called Jordan, it has the same flag as the &quot;palestinians&quot; are waving today, the problem is, and the heart of the conflict , that the palestinians dont want a jewish state in that region in any borders or shape, &quot;from the river to the sea&quot; their famous chant makes that clear.
Free Palestine.  The Jewish people should have been resettled in their homeland in Khazaria.
Please provide proof that Palestine was promised to the Arabs?  The Faisal-Weitzmann documents say otherwise. The Jews were promised Palestine, the Arabs were promised the rest of the land.
This is by far the best coverage of the conflict I have seen so far. Excellent!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGH94HoSJ2s&amp;t=85">1:25</a> wrong map for the Russian Empire in 1914.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGH94HoSJ2s&amp;t=659">10:59</a> it&#39;s pronounced Mesopotamia (meaning &quot;between the rivers&quot;), not &quot;Mesopotania&quot;
No cóż - Czy to nie przypadkiem dom Rotchildow ?<br>Ukraina Rosja UE czy to nie folvark Rotchildow WHO służby bezpieczeństwa narodowego wojsko etc ...
The conflict originated well before the times you speak of. This war began with Abraham, this is because he married an Egyptian slave named Hagar because his wife Sarah was barren. Hagar bore him a son named Ishmael. Later God made a covenant with Abraham and Sarah was able to conceive to him a son named Isaac. God choose to continue the covenant with Isaac and Ishmael tried to kill Isaac when Ishmael was 17 and Isaac only 2. Sarah and Abraham cast out Hagar and Ishmael. Ishmaels decendants are the islamists and Isaac&#39;s decendants are the Jews. You think we have more of a role in this than we do. This war is because of polygamy and God said they would be at war until Jesus returns. The prophecies are playing out still.
Neither Palestine Mandate nor Balfour Declaration had any legal authority in England: House of Lords ruled Zionism unlawful in 1922. It was dead in the water, 1923. Ramsay MacDonald revived it in 1924, and it ran, unlawfully, through to 1948
The present conflict has nothing to do with the this It is about one thing. The international community set up Israel And Israel has become one of the most successful and the only democratic countries in the middle east  Confluct is purely about the denial by Iran and it&#39;s Proxies of the right of Israel to exist. Nothing more
still dont get it
I&#39;ll just remind us all the Trans- Jordan Memorandum at the Cairo Conference of 1922, in which the Britts, rulers of Palestine, together with the Arab League States, takes off the Eastern part of palestine know as Jordan today from the equation of the &quot;Jewish Homeland in Palestine&quot; from the 1917 Balfour Dec.
There was also an involvement from British Baptists in Zionism
Muslim arabs and Turks colonised the area after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Jews are the original inhabitants.
Next explain Lebanon
So don’t blame Israel. Israel only accepted the solution.
Semite does not just refer to Jews
Good information for the new generations, and hope to see Palestine back on the map
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGH94HoSJ2s&amp;t=77">1:17</a>  Why does that say Mumbai?  It should be Bombay.
I am sure that the uprising involving Faisal also involved an obscure, unknown British officer and his Rolls Royce armoured cars, I am trying to remember his name, but clearly, I am not the only one to forget to mention T E Lawrence  &quot;of Arabia&quot;?
The fact that both Israelis and Arabs agree with this video shows how good it is
The British have so much to answer for. Around the same time as Balfour, the British were deploying the Black and Tans in Ireland to violently suppress the Irish population. When Ireland violently removed the British they sent the Tans to Palestine to destroy people&#39;s lives there. How much sorrow has been created by British interference is too much to measures.
The immigrant jews didn&#39;t buy up the fertile land, they bought malarial swamp land and agriculturally underdeveloped land which hadn&#39;t been irrigated or maintained under Ottoman rule for decades and by modern western methods turned the area into a habitable land to which, over the next few decades, thousands of arabs migrated to from their own underdeveloped areas.
It’s a UN made disaster.
Calling Palestinians, muslim Arabs ignores the wealth of genetic evidence that Palestinians have indigenous DNA (albeit with some Arab admixture). They are culturally Arabs but calling them purely Arab delegitimises there connection to the land.
Sure, I have heard of the Balfour Declaration. But until just now I had never had the chance to read what it actually says. It strikes me that for such an important document, it is surprisingly wishy-washy, to use the preferred academic term.<br><br>As a official statement, it simply expresses a preference. It is not a law, a foreign policy objective of the Crown, or a carefully arrived-at, negotiated treaty obligation.&#39;<br>It simply seems to be a carefully worded, straddle the fence thinking of the Foreign Office, designed not to give too much away to either side, designed to be abandoned or at least modified should shifting circumstances require it.<br><br>To make it the cornerstone of British foreign policy, is, to quote Sir Bernard Appleby, to put a burden on it that it is semantically and epistologically not designed to support&quot;.
The Ottomans were the failed colonial power that led to the British having to divide these lands up. Why no blame resting on Turkey?
So much suffering and pain for generations caused by the colonelist.
I hope that part 2 will deal with:<br>1. Did the colonial powers have a right to do the division? It is not addressed strongly enough;<br>2. Was Palestine empty land, and how does Asher Ginsberg’s observations of Palestine in 1891 relate to this notion;<br>3. There were serious fights between Jewish settlers and native Arabs in Palestine throughout the 1930s. It is glossed over, thereby underplaying the beginnings of the illegal land claims of the Zionists;<br>4. There were about 4 or 5 Zionist terror groups, among them the father of Benjamin Netanyahu and Menachem Begin, who famously claimed to be the original terr0rist;<br>5. Why was the Balfour Declaration addressed to Rothschild, in particular, and was that part of a deal to bring America in to support the British in the war? This piece doesn’t adequately deal with the background to the conflicting promises and why the Brits ultimately favoured the Zionists.<br>6. This piece also does not adequately deal with the root cause of the current conflict, the Zionists’ master plan of establishing Greater Israel. It is the fulcrum of the manifesto of the Likud Party, founded by Begin.<br><br>It is a matter of emphasis and important to understand the degree of culpability of not just the British Empire but also those currently in power in Israel who continue to push the Greater Israel agenda.
Doesn&#39;t need a 15-minute explanation to answer the question.<br><br>I can do it in a second:<br>Yes.
It&#39;s a 2000 yr old issue .
i thought god promised land
The flippant drawing of borders were the British’s specialty. I wouldn’t be surprised if they meticulously planned it this way.
A story that needs to be told. Thank you.
The enemies news says, it destroyed idf. Why all over the news, ga za is flattened and showing videos of crying? Lies for sympathy?,..
The Balfour agreement was never implemented, the British handed over the mess they made over to the UN, the UN set up Israel and Jordan from the British mandate.
We are witnessing the beginning of the end of support for Israel. The only way forward to a sustainable future for Israel is equal rights for all. End the apartheid. End Zionism.
Yes and no. It will soon be 100 years since the brits left...at some point the current inhabitants must be at fault...I mean look at germany and france or france and england, once death enemies but no more!
Sadly most conflicts in history are British made
It was not a British made disaster. It was events that you cannot control .
Britain  created trouble in all over the land they ruled .Devide&amp; Rule was their motto. Separated  Brunei  from Malaysia,  KUWAIT  from IRAQ  , created major conflict in Cyprus  in between  Greek &amp; Turkish speakers. Seperated Sudan&amp; Egypt , India &amp; pakistan .US  their foreign policy is  also devide and rule.
Palestine belongs to Palestinians.  <br>Britain had no right to hand over someone else&#39;s land to a third party who then went about stealing even more Palestinian land and claiming some kind of Biblical right to it when they were mostly atheist Eastern European fleeing persecution by mostly Christian European people. <br>Balfour himself was a rabid anti semite who closed the doors of the UK to European jewry with the illegal alien act. <br>Israel is an illegitimate state birthed in terrorism and ongoing genocide and the most heinous injustice still being perpetrated on the Palestinian people.
Yes it is partially a British made disaster...driven by the stupidity of entering World War 1 in the first place and joining the struggle almost immediately.
If you compare the treaties of Versailles, (the harshness of which is attributed to the rise of Hitler) Saint-Germain, Trianon and Sevres, it&#39;s very easy to distinguish the extreme amount of racism inherent in the European mindset of the period: Germany lost a minimum amount of land and Austria was disbanded to give the locals their own states while Turkey lost pretty much everything except a small portion of lowest value rural inner Anatolia and any non-Christian locals were instead colonized by Britain and France.
Nothing about Arab massacres of the Jewish communities. Odd
The more research i do the more i realize all these leftist kids really are just doing what they are told and have no idea the stuff they support.
The problem that I have what give the British empire the right on the land of Palestine? Especially give it to someone else.
Britain, you caused this mess. Fix it.
Very good and informative video - please do another part, preferably more to cover whole history of Isreali state
Why don&#39;t Western countries ever talk about how widespread antisemitism was in Europe before and during the time of Hitler? How did they manage to brainwash today&#39;s Jews into thinking that it was the Arabs who hated and discriminated against them?<br><br>We must note that European Jews were the ones that had gone through holocaust. The Middle Eastern Jews were not included in the onslaught by NAZIs.<br><br>The Delusion of Thinking Themselves as Jews: When some people of European and U.S. descent converted to Jews their culture and beliefs (not being themselves Middle Easterners) were probably radicalized. Thus, they may practice adulterated type of Judaism or none at all (for instance Zionists). Hitler being radical felt repulsive against the Jews in the West.<br><br>Let us delve back in history and note that the culture of religions in Europe and the Middle East were radicalized upon the formation and spread of Christianity by the ancient Roman empire. Before this period the wars may also be overthrowing of old kingdoms with new ones, but did not involved religion. In fact when Cyrus ruled his Empire and other subjects he never imposed or mandated for a particular religion to strictly be followed although Zoroastrianism was widely practiced in Persia.<br><br>However, during the era of Roman Empire, Christianity was also aggressively spread to many other dominated countries. Thereafter, crusades began to invade and grab lands of both Jews and Muslims. Lots of genocide were involved in the process. Thus, the crusades were forerunners of Christian zionism.<br><br>Today, it is Israel zionism that invade and grab lands in the Middle East. It is Israel with the support of U.S. that commit genocide. What is interesting is that these modern Zionist Jews originally came from Europe and they do not strictly observe Judaism; they are not even dark skin to be considered as Middle Easterner.<br><br>We have take into account how radical the empires of Europe and currently the U.S. What may be referred radical about these empires? They are idealists in dealing with their own political power, religion (Christianity), ideologies (democracy or communism). They push to expand their beliefs as imperialists. Thus, it is no wonder there always exist blood and war in their hands.
British have caused so much trouble and suffering around the world.  Ireland, India/Pakistan and Palestine to name a few.
Palestine. Iraq. Afghanistan. Ireland. India. Pakistan. South Africa. Zimbabwe. Kenya. Burma. Malaya....... there is a direct link with imperialistic failed british rule and current day wars
No more videos of how badly Russia is losing in Ukraine I see.
An  American  made  disaster!!<br><br>Blood  that  has  been  shed  now  and  in  past  years  by  these  modern  day   Jews   rest  on  the  hands  of  American  political  system.
The Israeli-Palestinian (real Muslim) conflict isn&#39;t about land, it is a clash of a primitive 7th century world view and modern, technological liberal democracy. Islam cannot survive in a modern context so it has no choice but to oppose that context. This conflict won&#39;t go away even if they manage to destroy Israel. This conflict is an existential necessity for Islam, which means it is an existential threat to the rest of us.
absolutely
1. Ottoman was once sending letter regarding about if war ever broke out in Europe they wanted to join triple Entente but rejected by British, France, and even Russian Empire because of their objectives doesn&#39;t aligned with any triple Entente nation. <br><br>2. Of all minister that holding power or we can say Three Giants in ottoman notably Minister of War Enver Pasha, Minister of Naval Djemal Pasha, and minister of interior Talaat Pasha were once students in the British and France studying all sectors then came in contact with nationalism idea.
Because no one had fought over the Holy Land before Britain meddled....
When will the west stop patronising the Arabs and see them accountable to their own actions?
You spelt Ottoman Empire&#39;s fault wrong.
No
Israel region was peaceful for 400 odd years of muslim rule then brits come along
The Arabs got two states based on their claim that they were a homogenous people, the Jews got one state based on their historic connection to the land of Israel, or Palestine as the British called the holy land. This became part of international law via treaty (Sevres). Balfour declaration was meaningless until it became part of the treaty of Sevres(article 95)
What the British seems to be doing when they gave up the colonies is to sow the seeds of future internal strife and conflicts.
Well really, it was the mongols that obliterated the Middle East.  If not for the Mongols, the Middle East would probably have remained strong and able to self determin.
yup<br>they promised the land to both sides and ran away after their plans blew up in their faces
So - although I would say a minor factor - - it wrought some very precarious and unhappy consequences in the years and decades to follow! It might have even been a complication with the Ukrainian matter of a couple of years ago. Though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s entirely so! Undoubtedly things came to a head in Gaza. There&#39;s a good reason why we shouldn&#39;t have done it! Caution was left to one side due to the First World War! Hmm! Some very complicated consequences for sure! Coming up to today in 2024! It&#39;s likely to end badly for many people on this planet! I&#39;d like to hope that it won&#39;t be too serious but unfortunately it will be!
Nope; nothing to do with the UK. We left before 90% of the UK population were born.
Lads we did it again!
Modern day Israel is a secular, apartheid state, not a kingdom governed by the law of God, neither were they gathered from out of the nations by God.<br>It&#39;s from the machinations of men, who think to usurp eternal kingdom promises (wherein dwelleth righteousness) to God&#39;s saints, here in this temporal age.
Great video but so few views 😢 <br>Pretty much confirms to few truly care about the issue and how it might get resolved.
Hindsight.
The whole Middle East is a disaster zone (except the bits with loads of oil and few people). No need to blame the British. You might as well blame the Bible.
Wow, let’s start the anti-British comments on here shall we…..! <br>Yes the British empire wasn’t perfect, but neither was any empire over human history, like the Aztec, Japanese, Roman, Ottoman, Zulu, Mongal, Inca, Chinese dynasties, etc etc.<br>Regardless of what the British colonial office planed out, the Arabs and the Jewish people would still be fighting. Humans have been fighting for thousands of years, even native’s were in conflict with each other way before colonialism by the various empires came to colonise. Religion, Politics and Wealth is the route of all evil and destruction. We today judge the past on both a high morality and hindsight, just like future generations will just us today for the derisions and mistakes of today.
No
Thanks Britain.
Don&#39;t blame us! It&#39; s the Americans&#39; fault!!  Seems reasonable.
Yep, its disaster. Look at it now.
The context is that it wasn&#39;t just the Arabs of Palestine,  but the same Arab nationalism was everywhere, Britain and France were fighting rebellions in Egypt, Iraq and Syria.   The statistics are kind of sus. Jewish immigrants were much more likely to be documented by British officials,  while Arabs would not.   This would skew the numbers, esp. if their extrapolation presumption of the population were inaccurate.  In &#39;48 Arabs still had a strong majority of the population.
A clear informational video that shows the history of the region. Looking forward to part two.
All the European colonial powers divided up the world by putting into the same territories groups of people who always lived in their own territory. This way, the native groups would fight among themselves rather than attack the colonial powers. That’s why ac
Blame it on the eastern roman empire for failing to keep out the saracens in 686AD.
please don&#39;t use figures from justin mccarthy. He is a well known armenian genocide denier and also fibs figures when it comes to the balkan wars and ww1.
Israel is a historical provable contemporary of Egypt and Babilon, so very much before Rome or Palestine!<br>Be ashamed!
Israel is a historical provable contemporary of Egypt and Babilon, so very much before Rome or Palestine!<br>Be ashamed!
Are you sure???<br>The Palestine was an invasion project of people of the Roman Empire based to import Greeks into Israeli shores to destabilize Israel.<br><br>Gerusalem was builded and is named Jerusalem by Israeli people before Romans.<br><br>UK have not much account for any mess.<br><br>There are no history remains referring to Palestine but you have plenty all referring to Israel!
Firstly,  The Levant has been the scene of wars for the last 4,000 years, primarily because of its location which is never going to change. War there is not the result of historically recent events, but caused by many other factors. <br>Secondly, it was the British who were largely responsible for getting various Arab peoples around the table to negotiate a solution to the many conflicting interests in the Middle East, and those peoples are as much a part of the problem as the agreement they signed up to. <br>Thirdly, it was known at the time that the agreement was not going to be a permanent solution. None of the signatories were entirely happy with it but accepted that it was necessary in order to prevent chaos in the area. <br>Finding a solution that all parties would be happy with is virtually impossible given that none of the peoples in the Middle East seem content to live in peace with their neighbours, so to simply blame the British is disingenuous.
They don&#39;t call the Union Jack a Butchers Apron for nothing hey.
Basically.palestine had a choice in 1947. Except the 2 state deal or not. They chose not to, attacked israel, lost, and lost most of the land they would have had. Not a smart move by palestine leaders. You could say there leaders have been garbage since the 1940s
So the British will clean up their mess and all will be well.<br>Maybe a single secular state called Balfouria would work.
Accordingly, Britain committed the first clear evident genocide against Palestinians, 17%, 1 in 6 of male population !!!!
So the Turks had subjugated most of the Middle East into the Ottoman Empire. When the British &amp; Commonwealth allies drove the Turks out of the Middle East &amp; back to their own borders they then had to negotiate with the various Arab groups to decide who owned what land after the Turkey had occupied for over a 600 years. Added to that were the varied interests of France &amp; the USA primarly for oil rights in these areas. The USA held the UK to the Balfour Agreement as did France &amp; consequently the UK had to balance the geographical situation in order to get a peaceful solution. This was achieved &amp; everyone was happy. However on the advent of WW2 The Germans actively encouraged the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to call on all Arabs(Muslims) to wage a Holy War against the French, Italian &amp; British. The then Grand Mufti was a Palestinian Arab who was against a Jewish State in Palestine . After serving in the Turkish Army in WW1 he was appointed by the Ottoman Empire as Jerusalems Grand Mufti or Leader of the Muslims in the Middle East. This appointment was ratified by the British in 1936 but a warrant was issued for his arrest after he instigated a revolt against British rule in Palestine after which he fled to Nazi Germany. He subsequently used his influence to incite anti British feelings hoping that Germany would conquer the Middle East with his help &amp; establish a Palestine State. After the War he returned to Lebonan under French protection &amp; began to form a Holy League against the Jews which eventually morphed into the Palestine Liberation Organisation whose offshoots are Hamas &amp; Hezbollah. It&#39;s easy &amp; convenient plus traditional it seems to blame previous UK Governments for the situation in the Middle East. But these blamers &amp; finger pointers neglect to factor in the Oil companies who had &amp; still have such an influence in Middle Eastern countries. Bear in mind that the majority of these oil companies are American. Now review your anti British opinions about the current Middle East situation &amp; perhaps you&#39;ll come to a different conclusion as to who is ultimately responsible for the current ongoing conflicts in that part of the world.
This video insists on separating Levantine Christians from Arabs, all are Arabs, some are Muslims and some are Christians
Kingdom of Israel 1047 BC. Palestinians became palestinians in 1967. 🇮🇱 🇮🇱 🇮🇱💪
Very interesting until about minute 4.16 or so when they started emitting their political opinion negative to Israel. So, Palestine is named after its people, the Palestinians? Isn&#39;t it that the Romans named the are Palestine and the arabs that went to live there took the name Palestinians after Palestine? And the Balfour Declaration was a bad mistake because it led to the formation of Israel? Sorry, stop watching after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW105kjNtho&amp;t=258">4:18</a>

I would never keep this nation from being born,” says your God.<br><br>*Ezekiel 36:9-11(NKJV)-9 For indeed I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown. 10 I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. 11 I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bear young; I will make you inhabited as in former times, and do better for you than at your beginnings. Then you shall know that I am the Lord.<br><br>*Ezekiel 36:30-36(NKJV)-30 And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations. 31 Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good; and you will [a]loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations. 32 Not for your sake do I do this,” says the Lord God, “let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!” 33 ‘Thus says the Lord God: “On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also enable you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt. 34 The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by. 35 So they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.’ 36 Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate. I, the Lord, have spoken it, and I will do it.”
Hamas&#39;s evil acts Oct 7th at the behest of Iran to stop the scheduled peace talks in Tel Aviv between the Arab countries and Israel..
The enemies news says, it destroyed idf. Why all over the news, ga za is flattened and showing videos of crying? Lies for sympathy?,..,
The UK should have to pay reperations to the Arabic
I think its funny how jews always destroyed and mamed land but all other religions rebuild wherever they go.
Hashemite were arabs from mecca Arabia , so it were more like imperial aspirations than nationalist aspirations. in other words, replacing ottoman empire with Hashemite empire.
The problem is Balfour and Rothchild decided to make a Jewish state when the land was pretty empty although under Ottoman control and dominated by arabs. By 1946, the land was a lot fuller from immigrants(arab and jewish). The arabs expected the land to be given to them considering they had been the majority population for a very long time under Ottoman rule. The Brits were under pressure to make a decision and end their colonial rule which made them pass the decision over to the UN. I think the Jewish people deserve land of their own but the arabs were the majority people. The arabs were already angry at immigration. The most peaceful method would have been to give the land to the arabs
The Britt’s really buggered the world didn’t they <br><br>BOHICA
It started w/ lies😊😊
This is a simple subject. It’s all traced to Israel’s ethnic cleaning of Palestinians from their homes and land and the subsequent apartheid system Israel set up to push out or subjugate the Palestinians. This is in addition to planned repression and brutality as well as laws that prevent the Palestinians from growing as family units and as neighborhoods. That’s why Israel not only massacred Palestinians before the state of Israel was founded but after as well. And add to that the periodic assaults on various villages massacring the inhabitants but also letting and helping settlers kill and terrorize the Palestinians. <br><br>It’s been a criminal enterprise since before the state of Israel was founded. Israel has lost its right to be a nation with its repeated crimes against humanity since its founding and its flagrant and repeated violations of international law and the Geneva conventions.
This video is biased. Israel existed 2,000 years ago. Romans named Judea &quot;Palestine&quot;.
The British may have stole/raped and massacred their way to a world 🌎 empire. But they weren&#39;t the first or the last. Being no better or worse than any other people. Human, with all the gifts and flaws that brings.
This documentary keeps on talking as if Palestine was a country well established with a president or so.  It was a piece of land where different ethnic groups of people lived there beside Arabs.
What I concluded is that Palestine sought for an Independent State when and only because the Jewish people wanted a State for Israel.
Still does not explain general Islamic hate for everybody and their terrorism
israel pulled a 911, killed their own people to try and justify the conquest of gaza
This was slanted against the Jews and was pro-Palestine.
WTF with all the blurring in this video?
Timely video. Enjoyed the content and historic perspective on the ongoing conflict between the Palestinian and Israeli people. I hope they will be able to find a solution so the hatred and killing ends. Concessions will be required on both sides I think, and an outside arbitrator will be key in my opinion.
What started the conflict today, is the inhumane treatment of the Palestinians and the Jewish influence in the United States Government.
There of generalizations and bias in this documentary.
Completely ignores and even downplays the horrors that Muslims have put Jews through since the 7th century. This conflict didn&#39;t start in the 1900&#39;s, it started in the 600&#39;s. Put simply, if all the Jews in Israel converted to Islam today, the conflict would be over, no one would talk about &quot;Palestinians&quot; or &quot;Palestine&quot; again except as a footnote in history.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW105kjNtho&amp;t=2757">45:57</a> ARE YOU LISTENING MR NETANYAHU DID YOU HEAR!? ARE YOU&#39;RE NOT LISTENING?!
The premise is incorrect.  The League of Nations approved the Jewish state in Palestine.  All of the &quot;it&#39;s all about broken British promises&quot; is propaganda.   The Arabs were well aware of the decisions that were being made by the Allied Nations who won the war and received title over Ottoman territory by treaty.
Thanks to the program designer for not covering up the end of the show with those dang prompts for the next program; though minimized it did not block the last speaker. I know, trivial, but for me it makes the staying to the end so enjoyable.
White European and American land thieves PRETENDING to be Israeli is the root of the problem.
The jews wanted a country for themselves, to scape persecution, and achieved it by mass migration and land purchases, which are peaceful means. In that sense I can only congrutulate them. The arabs had nothing to fear for lives and property, but didn&#39;t want the presence of a bunch of new people, whith different looks, tongues, and religions to their, and set to give their identity to the state. It&#39;s really nothing different from the anxieties many Europeans feel about mass arab migration, and I don&#39;t blame them. In the end both had valid points.
I&#39;ve been watching documentaries on Middle Eastern and Southern Asian countries recently and somehow, whenever the documentary refers to the root of the conflict/genocide/whatnot, the &quot;honourable mention&quot; almost always goes to Britain that  in some way managed to f*** up something 😐
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk defeated and humiliated the English for better good..
Does anyone else find the horror film-esque music cringey? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW105kjNtho&amp;t=967">16:07</a>
The censorship 😡
GREED
I am trying to find this or another good explanation of the Israel/Palestine history with Thai subtitles or soundtrack.  World history rates rather low in the Thai curriculum and older members of my family find following documentaries in English difficult.  Any links or suggestions most appreciated.  Here&#39;s hoping that 2024 sees a reduction of the many suffering innocents around the world.
It&#39;s always the white race that takes land gold,oil diamonds,  etc. At some races of color, we need to stand together against  the people who want to victimize us.
The promised land is the land of Israel! Simple.  Even the claimants, their own expert have said, thy don&#39;t have any proof 🧾!  From 1948, nobody could defeat Israel!,.,,.
According to google&#39;s bard ai: <br><br>The Canaanites were an ancient civilization that lived in the region known as Canaan, roughly corresponding to modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, parts of Syria, and Jordan. Their peak flourished during the Bronze Age, specifically the Late Bronze Age (1550-1200 BCE).<br><br>Here&#39;s a breakdown of their key aspects:<br><br>Who:<br><br>Not a single, unified group: While referred to as &quot;Canaanites,&quot; they likely comprised various ethnicities and city-states with diverse cultural nuances.<br>Semitic-speaking: Their language belonged to the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family, similar to ancient Hebrew and Aramaic.<br>Seafaring and trading: Skilled seafarers and traders, they established numerous ports and coastal cities that thrived on commerce.<br>Polytheistic: Worshipped a pantheon of gods and goddesses, including Baal, El, Asherah, and Anath.<br><br>Where:<br><br>Centered on the eastern Mediterranean: Their territory mainly encompassed the lands along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, from Lebanon in the north to the Sinai Peninsula in the south.<br>Urbanized: Lived in numerous city-states and towns, some famous examples being Ugarit, Megiddo, Jericho, and Jerusalem.<br>Farming and trade: Practiced agriculture and animal husbandry, while maritime trade played a vital role in their economy.<br><br>Legacy:<br><br>Cultural influence: Their language, art, and religious practices exerted significant influence on neighboring cultures, including the Israelites.<br>Archaeological insights: Excavations of Canaanite cities and artifacts offer valuable clues about their daily life, economy, and beliefs.<br>Biblical connection: The Hebrew Bible frequently mentions the Canaanites, portraying them as rivals or enemies of the Israelites.
I still support the right of the Jews to have their own country. YET, you take Palestine, you take the Kashmir issue : just any lingering problem around the world is due to British DIVIDE &amp; RULE POLICY. Confound the British, their machinations &amp; dirty minds.
The Israelies are arrogant and self obsessed, ignorant!
It&#39;s a religion not a country!
Thank you for this documentary. Very informative.. Thank you for this documentary. Very informative..
Thanks!
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Too many ad breaks.....
Brilliant documentary
“You can’t reconcile one with the other” - meanwhile the whole of the former Ottoman Empire is Islamic except for a small sliver in the Levant. There wouldn’t be a Saudi Kingdom if it wasn’t for those promises kept! Next time get better historians. Smh
The far right ads are ruining the viewing of this documentary
here is an answer - terrorist attacks.. what else? did you really think that if you gas lighted the issue that people would forget? and no, it was not one person who created this issue, it was the meddling of the west and the need t control the entire world
Israelis should grant passports to the Palestinians and let them participate in a secular government. Religion was created to make people united and now it has opposite effect, so it should get out of the equation.
Ok the PLO is a terrorist organization created by the same guy who begged a certain German Chancellor for, then organized and funded the all Islamic Division of the SS.  In fact much of the first generation PLO was made up with the same All Islamic division of the SS.  <br>So stop white washing the hate against the indigenous Jews of Israel.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HistoricalWorld-1">https://www.youtube.com/@HistoricalWorld-1</a>
very clear picture about israel and palestine ,enlightment of jews and lacking  of pelstine...and arab world..
Why is it censored?
As a Turk, i can’t unsee the pain Ottomans lived because of betrayal. ‘What goes around comes around.’ How true it is.<br>Again, as a Turk, i don’t think that it is not a 100-0 war, it is a 50-50 one. Yeah, i’m Muslim too.
Why would British do that?

The future blames the past
I hate having to say Im from UK
Terrorist Arab invaders stole North Africa
UK 🇬🇧 and USA 🇺🇸 are the problem to the world chaos 😢
Britain 🇬🇧 should take back the Zionist Jewish garbage that they exported to Palestine 🇵🇸 and free up the Palestinians land that they have robbed for past 75 years
Who occupied Palestine before the Israelis ?
What is the history of palatine?
Humans are we? But what we left behind, power selfishness and sorry for habitation, ruling and taking control, well baffled my mind, but people are so cruel
History is always repeating
So basically palestine wanted the un map 1947 , an the israeli want the map before jesus died ? 😅
See anything,  believe anything.  Jesus is a Jew born in Israel long before the syrians, Jordaninas and Egyptians occupied Gaza.
The indigenous people are Jews. That is their land. It goes back before 70AD. And the arabs dont want the land, they want to rid an entire race of Jews and Christians.  Period. Anything other than that truth is a LIE.
The men , the women , the children.  All killed indiscriminately by the state of israel. Over 12,000 people dead. Nearly 3,000 missing likely dead under the rubble. Over 5,000 children are dead. Babies in thier incubators die without electricity . Women must have c sections without anesthetic since they have no medical supplies. Entire bloodlines erased from the planet.  People have thier flesh burned to the bone by white phosphorus . Yet the media will tell you these innocent civilians are the barbaric ones, they&#39;ll tell you they are the terrorists. Its not complicated,  its not new. It is flat out genocide of the Palestinian people. Free palestine , and have the day you deserve.
Why is it that so often the case that these - historical - presentations speak in term of nations? It should be noted the same &quot;British&quot; they speak of here, sent their mortal subjects in as - canon fodder - in the likes of Gallipoli. However the all knowing leftist today want to put a large portion of today&#39;s British in the line of sight for their venom. All the time the corporates continue to do as they please. The old Divide &amp; Conquer, ticking along precisely.
The Brits like to eff up things.... They have a lot to answer for.

Its was the Balfour declaration and Haavara agreement. They say who they are. AskenNAZI jews
are you sure? i taught  they (B.... )knew the consequences, they didn&#39;t care. their concern was their power, every one else could fight and kill each other once they get what they want. just saying, need to know more
So...this post is for people who, like, live under rocks or whatever
why in the world would you content providers/developers of this video use SO MUCH BLURRED OUT footage.. this detracts immensely from the continuity.
I blame Romans for everything that happen, if they didn&#39;t rename that Judea lands into Palestine, this will never happen.
I shared to Facebook. It wasn&#39;t easy. The fb &#39;fact checker&#39; bot automatically tried to sensor this; as is usual for anything pro Israeli. I circumvented by leading with a comment containing an emoji. That seems to confuse their bots.
Islam did. <br>That&#39;s it. <br>That&#39;s the entire story.<br>There&#39;s literally nothing more to add.
Need to go further back, they are fighting over Gods promised land, this is an ancient conflict. Half brothers at war.
Oil<br>The new discoveries of oil and natural gas in the Levant Basin, amounting to 122 trillion cubic feet of natural gas at a net value of $453 billion (in 2017 prices) and 1.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil at a net value of about $71 billion, offer an opportunity to distribute and share a total of about $524 billion among the different parties, in addition to the many intangible but substantive advantages of energy security and cooperation among long-time belligerents. They can also potentially be a source of additional conflict and violence if individual parties exploit these resources without due regard for the fair share of others. What could be a source of wealth and opportunities could prove disastrous if this common resource is exploited individually and exclusively, without due regard for international law and norms.
If you lead with an ad in the first second I’m quitting the video
You know, I’m a very proud Scot. I’ve done my DNA. I’m 84% Scottish and 16% Irish. I have degrees in history including a masters. This is something I know very little about. I’ve never considered myself British. I have dual nationality with another country. I find English colonial history abhorrent. Not that European ruling powers were any better, often worse. There has always been a complete and utter disregard by the ruling classes for those below them. By the ruling classes I mean the governments and military. No woman would do what they did, I believe that if their wives and daughters knew what they were actually doing, they would have been appalled. But they were kept ignorant and powerless. As usual. All this is men’s history, with women swept up in it, cleaning up and nursing the sick, wounded and dying. Only to to replace the dead, raise them with love, to be slaughtered again. Give me strength. War wears me out.😢
I just watched this documentary under a different title.
Many of the facts in this video are really up to who is telling the story. The land called Palestine once referred to the people living there, which included Christians, Arabs and Jews. Yes, at one time before the Israeli state was formed, Jewish people living in the land of Palestine were referred to as Palestinians. Same for Christians and Arabs.  One could also argue the issue between the Arabs and Jews goes much farther back into ancient history, as described in the Bible.
Britain subordinating all residents in Middle East to   interests of the empire. Bet 1 percent of the world watching know how much this is the product of the British Empire.
TEAM ISRAEL
That land was Judea long before the Romans called it Palestine as punishment for revolt.
To create the State of Israel, Zionist forces attacked major Palestinian cities and destroyed some 530 villages. Approximately 13,000 Palestinians were killed in 1948, with more than 750,000 expelled from their homes and becoming refugees – the climax of the Zionist movement&#39;s ethnic cleansing of Palestine. It is called Nakba, catastrophe.  Since its creation, it has always been practiced ethnic cleansing until this day. Zionist Israel never wants 2 state resolutions.
It baffles me that many minorities who are openly supporting Hamas (a terrorist network whose sole objective is to slaughter the Jews of the earth and destroy the State of Israel) are supporting a movement that would easily throw them off a building in a heartbeat once they stepped into Gaza. <br><br>If you think you’d be safer in Gaza as a homosexual than in Tel Aviv, you’re a fool…
So every single conquering army over the last 2000 years, that arrived with sword in hand, slaughtered the inhabitants and seized the territory have no culpability. But when the British and French arrive, create sovereign Arab nations, and leave, the violence is all their fault. Multiculturalism for White people only, I guess.
Now look what&#39;s happening to England. It&#39;s all about greed.
Let&#39;s be honest.  This has been going on for longer than the last few centuries.  If you are of the Abrahamic faith, it began with Isaac and Esau.  If not, I offer other evidence.  They built the dome of the rock on top of the temple mount holy to judaism, in the 7th century.
When western world has rich jews from Europe to others, why does USA has to pay package of such huge sum of notes to Israel why not other nations? And same to Ukraine I mean somewhere you have to think note and understand what is going on behind this facade
It&#39;s depressing, but I have to watch. The little knowledge I do have keeps me from taking sides. The more I learn about this topic, the less hope I have for what lies ahead.
So... The main culprit for this unfathmoble mess is... Britain.<br><br>They must stand much more to their historic responsibility.
❤❤
Too much Ya Allah

What you are photographing is not true! It is enough to tell lies that Hamas is the one that started the war and in this Palestine of yours Israel has done nothing! More than 1000 people were murdered for her and that&#39;s what you say. I have no words for this world anymore!🇮🇱🇺🇸🇮🇱🇺🇸

This is honestly heartbreaking… but did that kid have the R9 cut?
Ramadan is coming soon. Palestinians had fasted beforehand because there was not enough food during the genocide. They are used to being patient because every day they lose children, fathers, mothers, siblings, homes and humanity from world leaders. May Allah bless the Palestinian people and those who have fought for Palestine
O God, these are Your weak, faithful Muslim servants in Gaza. I ask You, O God, with all Your beautiful names and sublime attributes, to support them, save them, and make the status of their dead the highest paradise.

Wow so beautiful 😂😂,   good acting by Palestinians
this is why God forbid us Jews from reforming Israel prematurely. Per midrash of the Torah we are to live in the lands of others for over 300+ years still do them no harm and have none done to us. This is in direct violation of the very word of God. And this is why God forbid us from reforming now. And I condemn the actions of Israel as a Jew outside of Israel.
They say thank you thank you paramedics, we love you so much

Prayer from Surah  3:195 - “I will never deny any of you—male or female—the reward of your deeds. Both are equal in reward. Those who migrated or were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted for My sake and fought and ˹some˺ were martyred—I will certainly forgive their sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, as a reward fromGod. And with God is the finest reward!.”

Another great video
sorry but you have many errors in your report. The peace process between Arafat and Rabin was not stopped by Hamas.
watching this after the red sea crisis. Well predicted sir!
This is vastly incomplete. Hamas attacked because Gaza is under occupation by Israel. They are a resistance movement. This started in 1948, not the 1990s 🙄 Also, Izzy created and was previously funding Hummus to weaken the PLO and prevent a Palestinian state.
Dark things are going on over that part of the world!
As in the documentary shown in the video in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT93a0ENcqg&amp;t=390">6:30</a> Israeli occupation made the unemployment rate skyrocket
This history lesson is actually quite biased.
This video is nowhere close to reality. It is bits and pieces of what has truly been happening on the ground. You should acknowledge the indigenous people and the country before 1947. The British mandate granted Zionist Jews the right to establish a nationhood on the land of the indigenous Palestine. The 1948 was actually called the year of Nakba, Catastrophe when Jewish Zionists alongside support of Britain invaded Palestine, mass murdered and forced ethnic cleansing of over 500,000 Palestinians. In 1920s, Palestine was home to Christians, Jews and Muslims but with the British mandate, Jewish Zionists had been fleeing into the country and causing chaos. Meanwhile today, Hamas does not control Gaza. Israel has placed a siege on Gaza in 2006 not to mention that Gaza was mainly refugee camps, ethnically cleansed Palestinians by Israel. Gaza is under the biggest open prison in the world and since 2006, Israel’s siege on Gaza, Israel has only been allowing 20% of goods that used to enter pre-2006. Did you know that in 2016, Israel banned chocolate, wedding dresses and even coriander amongst other goods. Help me understand how wedding dresses are used to make weapons? Or coriander? <br><br>Stop this propaganda and educate yourself properly on the matter. Pick a book and read about this conflict beyond the surface because as of today, Israel has killed over 30,000 Palestinians and dropped over 30,000 tons of explosives, that’s the equivalent of 2x of the Hiroshima bomb. So educate yourself before you confirm or take a stance. No war justifies the targeting of civilians mainly children. This is a genocide on children!
Its not a war its freaking occupation! Simple and clear!
Liar 🤣
You missed one point isreal is occupying west Bank
Balfour declaration 1948 started it. In Palestine, all three religions lived there peacefully until this event. Lord Balfour handed to Lord Rothschild the Palestinian land which was under the British mandate at that time like many countries worldwide were at that time. Indian had gotten independence only a year before that.
Good analysis, but you keep making the assumption that normalisation with israel = peace, which is simply not true - not if we consider the atrocities that israel commits against Palestinians in their own land. In fact, normalisation, especially of Saudi with israel, would serve as a validation for israel to continue its occupation and human rights violations in Gaza and the West Bank.
This video was helpful in understanding how it could affect Indian.
I was with you until you blamed the October 7th attack on Iran <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT93a0ENcqg&amp;t=772">12:52</a> let&#39;s stop spreading fake news. This claim has already been debunked, not only by the Iranians but also, by the Americans
The accent… omg
Elections were held in 2006 . Hamas was encouraged to participate by the US and Israel. It was supervised by Jimmy Carter and declared to be free and fair. Hamas was not expected to win. It won the elections , there was a civil war between Hamas and the PLO and Hamas got control of Gaza while the PlO got control of the West Bank . A  coup attempt failed to oust Hamas and Hamas was declared a terrorist organization by the US and Israel and a blockade was implemented. Nothing goes into Gaza and nothing comes  out except with  special permissions and very rare to get it. The area is 5 miles by 25 miles and has 2.4 million people with half being children. Israel controls air space ,the sea , water ,food ( calories are calculated per person to be just above starvation ),fuel, medicines of Gaza. They have severe food insecurity as per UN.  70 percent of people are displaced people from the 1948 nakba. There is very high unemployment. From time to time there have been many Israeli military operations referred to as “ mowing the lawn” to control Hamas.
The world&#39;s monopoly of war, Israel army versus Palestian civilian
We must free palestine
We mist go help palestine
Its not a conflict it us a Genocide of Palestinian muslims
Isreal has no right to defend itself against the Occupied resistance.
Amazing video. In all my years I&#39;ve never heard anyone explain these issues as clearly and ad thoroughly. If only our own media could manage this.
Half story. He missed Israel&#39;s has invaded Palestine. first  Israel is a terrorist state
Bogus facts 👎🤮
Dig deeper check it out, bibi Netanyahu openly admits that Israel funded hamas to counter West Bank . Divide and conquer, nothing new!
And India is trying to take advantage for aupporting US and Israel. Lol.
I urge, muslim countries take Biden and  Netanyahu as war criminals.
Will 3 rd world start - PLEASE
according to the united nation,Palestinians have right to armed struggle against Israeli occupiers,so hamas can&#39;t be called terrorists.
according to the united nation,Palestinians have right to armed struggle against Israeli occupiers,so hamas can&#39;t be called terrorists.
But that only palestine is suffering from more than 70 years so there is no right to palestine to fight for their rights....
So upcoming yrs there will be world war 3
iran will never block way, <br> muslim middleeast countries only not have oil<br> renewable energy is best source

Can you make short followup videos( may be ytshorts) to the current situation on these geopolitical situation .
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT93a0ENcqg&amp;t=597">9:57</a> you said &quot;Inspite of Hamas being a Sunni group, it maintained good ties with Saudi Arabia.&quot; However, Saudi Arabia itself is a Sunni majority country. What does this line mean then?

Israel stole their land resources and water. if Iran sends money to Hamas then US also sends money to Israel 😂😂😂

Israel was oppressing Palestinians for many years ,What was that Shouldn&#39;t we call him terrorist attack ?
The world need trump to make peace
Background and facts:<br>➡ After the Nakba, 750,000 Palestinians were forced to leave their homes <br>➡ 78% of Palestine was captured, the remaining 22% became West Bank &amp; Gaza<br>➡ The West Bank has over 700,000 illegal Israeli settlers (UN report)<br>➡ In the past 15 years, 6,407 Palestinians and 308 Israelis were killed <br>➡ 75 years of oppression has made 5.9 million Palestinian refugees <br>➡ Israel is committing apartheid (Amnesty International)<br>➡ Gaza: Israel’s ‘Open-Air Prison’ (Human Rights Watch) <br>➡ There are 65+ Israeli laws that make Palestinians 2nd class citizens <br>➡ Israel has arrested around 17,000 women &amp; girls and 50,000 children since 1967
During the Oslo, Israel gained control over 60% of the West Bank, land and its water resources, and implemented electric fences &amp; walls to divide Palestine. So it&#39;s wasn&#39;t a peace treaty.
Great! But, you did not touch up on how Israel was created and the crimes they did to occupy Palestine.
&quot;For a change, US was trying to actually work for peace&quot;<br><br>😂😂<br><br>Sorry. That got me laughing.
So nicely explained🥹
How biased is Think School, when telling the history of Israel vs Palestine, just conflict since 1948? Who&#39;s land it is, who are settlers? Think school Ganesh Prasad claims as centrist, there are no centrists, they are mostly right wingers, he has no integrity of reporting facts and standing to justice. Wondering if he&#39;s every going to report Modi Adani Coal Scam, since he always cover with angle of Indian economy, will that be covered unbiased or going to typical Godi media Youtuber!
Isra3l People India Love You.. 🇮🇳❤️🇮🇱 You love India Or Not Isra3l? 😂😂😂😂
As usual Indian perspective, ignorant, lacking the history of Palestine and Israel war. Biased.
You forgot to mention nearly $300 billion trade between Middle East and India, around 18-20% of India&#39;s foreign trade comes to the Middle East. This makes the Middle East India&#39;s largest trading partner. <br>Additionally, Economic corridor called North-South, aimed to connect South Asia (including India) with resource rich Central Asia and Russia(either through Afganistan or Iran). <br>Moreover, India also using Suez canal located inside Egypt to trade with Europe.
Trade route being built from India through the ME and the meltdown area to EU..
Hy Ganesh sir, In every election you made video about the development of that state, work of government<br>Why not with MP😢
Correction, Israel only wants peace if they can remove the Palestinians from West Bank and Gaza Strip. They are on the cusps of achieving full take over of the West Bank removing the Palestinians
Correction US intentions is not about making peace but merely to divide and conquer. True peace starts with Iran and Saudi Arabia and Israel. Not some smaller Nation. That is why China Made peace in 2023 between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Correction, Iran is not the main contributor to Hamas, it is Qatar and Hamas was created by Israel to destroy the PLO. Thirdly after WW2 the problem started when Israel killed 750000 Palestines while starting to take away the West Bank. Look at historical maps showing the changes from 1947 to today. You need to have the historical context correct.
Israel is like our Indian neighbors who keeps on extending their territory
Absolute filth… didn’t expect this

Aswom bro
Very informative
Why don’t you talk about israel settlers stealing Palestinian lands that is cause why hamas attacks them
Although I am in support of Israel but America is playing it&#39;s cards well, :- not bad 😢
Sir, thank you for your video but you got so much wrong in regards to the Palestine and isreal wars.  In particular you forgot to mention that isreal was never a country until 1948 when the UK government (at the end of the Second World War) gave Palestine’s country to Jewish people against the rights of the Palestine people. The Jewish people immediately went on a murdering campaign (using weapons the uk gave them) driving palestine people out of the farms and cities and took over the country.  Palestine people became refugees in their own country.  Finally under president Clinton the Palestine’s and Isreal prime ministers made a truce and agreed that pale stone would be given back some of their land and be their own state again.  Unfortunately a zealot Jew who was unhappy with the Isreal prime minister signing this truce assassinated that Isreal prime minister and Netanyahu took over the leadership in isreal. Netanyahu refused to accept the truce signed by the assassinated  prime minister and denied the Palestine’s right to have some land back and be their own state.  Since the the Netanyahu government have fenced Palestine people into two areas of the country and heavily policed them including doing what Netanyahu calls mowing the grass. This just means he has the military bomb them every so often to keep them under control. In the Gaza Strip Palestine people are not free to come and go. It’s the largest open air prison on the planet.  If anyone leaves without seeking government permission they are killed.  Just like any prison isreal controls everything that comes into the prison including food, water and electricity.  They can cut these off anytime as they have done recently. Some historians researching Gaza have shown that the Israel government carefully measures food coming in so that people are just above the starving line.  The Hamas formed and was actually encouraged and helped by the Netanyahu government. They felt that if Hamas was in place in opposition to the mild mannered Palestine government then the Palestine would begin fighting amongst themselves and this would leave them less time to fight against their oppressors, Israel. That did not work.  Hamas ended up in leadership over the Gaza Strip and the Palestine government remained the government of the West bank. Although neither were true governments as Palestine people are not recognised as citizens of Israel and the country Palestine ceased to exist when the Israel’s took over in one of the bloodiest wars there in 1948.  At the time of the recent uprising by Hamas Netanyahu was in deep trouble with his people. He had been charged with several crimes of corruption and should have been in jail but he used his position to change the laws in the country which saved him and in the months leading up to this attack by hamas Isreal people were marching daily calling for his sacking.  He actually was so stressed by this he has a heart issue in September and needed a heart pacer.  The Gaza Strip is the most surveilled area on the planet and some say it would be impossible for hamas to have broken through the fence and run riot for more than 5 minutes before attack helicopters would be there to stop them.  Despite is they run amok for more then 7 hours with military intervention.  Ask yourself how that can be so. Recently a young man who was an Israel and patrolled that part of the strip says he think this was a inside job, a false flag done to save Netanyahu in his time of political crisis.  This young man even claims that in late September the Israel army ordered the removal of all the weapons from the guards of the Gaza Strip.  I think this event may well be more comp,teed than we think but for now we have Israel carpet bombing heavily populated areas of civilians killing a child every 15 minutes inside a tiny area which is a prison and where civilians cannot escape even if they wanted to.
You didn’t mention the Hindus working in Arabs countries and supporting Israel shamelessly. Arabs will kick the Hindus out

If Hamas attacked Israel and got support by Iran which is surely true, why Israel did not attack Iran or Hamas back? why it started attacking Palestinians the only reason is it wants to make Jerusalem its capital so it could make its temple, if I am wrong go and check for Jerusalem, and as we all know that it is not the capital of Israel.  which is clearly written in the Holy Quran. stop marketing your side by saying it is right. people maybe i am wrong but please read it on your own don&#39;t trust anyone&#39;s case studies I think this case study should be about shaking the world economy, but it is all about Hamas and Iran partnership and making Israel a victim which is not true!!

Brother it&#39;s not a conflict  its colonisation as Israel is occupying Palestine &#39;&#39; the masjid al aqsa&quot;
I am surprised by the Indian people for standing by Israel, but in the past they suffered the same hardship as the Palestinian people, during the time of the East India Company when it occupied their country, and when the Indians were defending their country, the world described them as savages, but I always said that the Indian people have the right to defend their country, but after Over time, this same people abandoned the truth that Israel occupied Palestine for 75 years and until now, just as the East India Company occupied India for many years, so why do you side with the bad ones?
Only single point supporting economic downturn rest all were history 😂😂😂

Netanyahu have no respect for Israelis! &quot;The biggest insult to the memory of the Holocaust is not denying it but using it to commit genocide against the Palestinian people.&quot; ~ Norman<br>Finkelstein
You mean Hamas police officers 🙄
Holocaust of Muslims in Palestine is continue support of Western world and Western media
It is indeed terrible what the Palestinians are going through. What Hamas is doing to them is terrible and terrible. There is no contradiction between supporting the Palestinian people and understanding the Israeli side that is simply reacting to the murder and rape of civilians. And for Palestinians to stop dying, maybe Hamas should stop using them as human shields. It will help.
How could the health minister of Gaza have all these statistics?? They are underground! They are Hamas run! Is this a joke? 😂
The symbolism behind these black banners of Khurasan runs deep, signifying not only a display of <br>military might but also instilling fear in those who oppose the Islam. Muhammad Qasim is Mahdi

The IDF is the most cowardly military on earth. They killed more hostages than they rescued,
Iran&#39;s terrorist leaders don&#39;t represent Iranian citizens as Islam is collapsing inside Iran and no Iranian supports their terrorist leaders
Not police officers but they are all terrorist because there&#39;s no police,no civilians,no unrwa but everyone is terrorist,very funny thing is tunnel under UNRWA camp wasn&#39;t aware which was built after they vacated,😅😅😅 how can with full facilities can be constructed just after the war was started.
ISRAIL HAS LOST THE MORAL RIGHT TO EXIST . IT SHOULD NOT B ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WITH THIS EVIL AGENDA OF GENOCIDE OF HUMANS.
They must only let woman and children go. 90% of the men are Hamas.
Why weren’t the police helping the people get out of the designated war zone? 🤷🏻‍♂️ This doesn’t make sense?
Israel will lose.
When Muslim countries take action?
Its a war again
The hatred for Jews is insane. We don’t hear about Syria, Yemen, or any other place where Muslims are killing Muslims in far greater numbers. But soon as the Jews kill a Muslim then the world is supposed to care. They elected Hamas and brought this on themselves.
Majority muslim countries like Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Bangladesh Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Egypt, are all backward and dysfunctional thanks to is lam. They all harbor terrorists and are in constant  violent conflict within themselves and their neighbors
This Iranian foreign minister always talking the language of the end of Israel and Netanyahu, redline and he doesn&#39;t feel a shame while his country losing many generals and commanders in Syria, Gaza, Yemen and hizbollah, they are killing young boys just for payment of 700 US
Time is so short!<br>If you haven&#39;t already done so, please put your trust in Jesus whilst you can!<br>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)

NETANYAHU have permission to RAFAH, don&#39;t wondering Netanyahu wears biden shoes a gifts blinken!!!???..ISREALS can&#39;t go aheads untill getts ACCEPTS USA..
HUMANS  - ARE SO CLEVER
Ask Hamas where they go. Why is it now Israels responsibilities in a war.
Isreal is bombing rafah crossing have nothing to do with hamas.
We comment the truth unveiling
Israeli not trustworthy
THE HEALTH MINISTRY IN GAZA HAS NO INTEGRITY TO BE BELIEVED ON!
The U N must confuscate HAMAS missiles to avoid Israel fro chasing them
Israel is fighting a JUST WAR but avoid harm to non- combatant civilians, Israel is warning first👍<br><br>IF  it was  HAMAS Terrorists planning a military action,  they would JUST BULL DOSE <br>WITHOUT.
Dudes bias! <br>Hanas doesn’t have the weapons to cause the destruction thats happened in Gaza <br>The weapons responsible for the damage are the weapons  the IDF has!
israel want all gazans dead or out ...its not about Hamas ...its an excuse for genocide and GAS
Dear HEAVENLY FATHER. we are so sorry that Muhammad Netzer and others in his shoes got involved in all this but we are praying sincerely for all other hamas operatives to wisely follow his example... Also praying that all those beautiful, sweet children of Gaza will resume schooling by loving caring teachers who&#39;ll teach them songs like.            &quot;🎹  Be unto others kind and true,                                           And always unto others do,      As u&#39;d have others do unto you&quot; 🎹. <br>Internalize and appreciate the  value of slogans like.                 &quot;Life is beautiful,  cherish it&quot;  Understand proverbs like,           &quot;if you live by the sword, you shall die by the sword.&quot;. Praying now that that caring desire of the ISRAELI PRESIDENT will b fulfilled that the children of Gaza will be taught  to love as JESUS LOVED, will receive  the love that will cause them to flourish for bright futures O my heart breaks as I desire for them. teachers, friends and guardians, who can successfully get them thru the heartache and pain of ti&#39;s terrible war, help them understand and  know THE ONE TRUE GOD, the only ONE who knows the answers and the reasons so that they don&#39;t have to go thru life on the speculators of their pasts,  the blind faith of parents WHO may  misled them, sit any longer under the preachings of self-agrandising or well meaning  leaders, on pre- supposition and empty worthless dreams of others, rather having realisable dreams of their own, AND  that GOD HIMSELF will b their parent, their teacher, their leader, and their TRUTH.! This is the longing of my heart and my fervent prayer and  come now  all who are in sympathy, millions of others, Christians, Muslim, Hindus, Jews all who are sad about the  catastrophic bereavement of the past 128 days,  COME NOW let us agree with this prayer and join me in this prayer of intercession and supplication. Prayer by far outweighs, riots, violence, force, demonstrations. Those are easy but &quot; THE EFFECTIVE FERVENT PRAYER OF THE RIGHTEOUS, AVAILETH MUCH.! AMEN  ? AMEN.?<br>YES AMEN.! ! !
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sorry Palestinian
Gaza’s health ministry is literally a terrorist organization, why anyone quotes their numbers is beyond comprehension.
You analyst is dumb and clueless,  talking zionist nonsense
It&#39;s clear form this video that UNRAW is lieing.
Iranian leadership lack wisdom
UN=Underground Network
In Rafah Israel is commiting war crimes with the support of usa
Only iran and Yeman  backing the  palestine . Where is the rest ??
From the river to the sea their will be no Hamas
Hamas tidak perlu menyrah. Hamas harus di basmi. Karena nafsu menyebabkan jatuhnya banyak korba.💪💪💪💪👍👍👍
Why the world&#39;s still spectator on such act of jewish refugees.
Why are the Palestinian civilian are refusing to evacuate when the idf and the Israel government has warmed them to leave the area? What is the secret of not obeying?
Where is palestine soldiers? Only hamas militia or government in palestine?
No one can tell Hamas to come out so they gonna go back home
Why the world  leaders  are  not  trying  to release  the Israel  hostages. Instead  they are sheeding crodile tears for Palestines.All hipocracy. Israel P M is right in taking  decisions to release  the hostages.  God bless Israel and the P  M  and I D F.
Even Egypt don&#39;t want them
Is the Muslim world okay about the Palestinians situation?<br>From the bottom of your heart are you true Muslims?
Isrealis became totally insane dehumanized able to commit atrocities
I made war to secure Peace but a peace that could last for a couple of dozens of decades. Napoleon Bonaparte
Not a single country sending aid to the suffering Palestinians.  Not even China, Russia,  India,  North Korea,  Iran etc.
As of now Egypt should be blamed squarly for not allowing Palestinians to seek refuge in their country.  Where is the Muslim Brotherhood ?
Why not question the status of innocent isreali civilians still in Hamas Terrorist captivity? Are they not important? Hamas started this all October 7 and Palestinians civilians were seen celebrating October 7.
🏴‍☠️
ANTIRAPE
This Iranian FM farts a lot. 😂😂😂😂
38,000 is way far from 100,000
What type of treatment is this!!
Only one state !!!! PALESTINA!!!!!
Why is no one asking Hamas to surrender?
Netanyahu already started attacked on Lebanon so what leaders are talked about....
Israel has the right to defend itself and  protect their citizens. Hamas and UNRWA are tasked with ensuring the welfare of the people in Gaza.
Israel Loves to Lies to Much!!!
So this means  it&#39;s Iran at war with Israel not proxies so Iranian are a target
Where is humanity?

Religion, racism and nationalism are the true evils fuelling this conflict.
The rafah crossing is controlled by Egypt not Israel
The British always messed up a country with psychological warfare inciting hate and violence.  Sounds like Trump.
If you read Hamas charter and then you realize the Gazan people voted for violence.
When British draw borders, their intention is not to make it a closed territory but fight for ages.
one sided story
The question at this point is, which media house is telling the truth?
who  started the war in 1948?<br>who started the war in 2023?<br><br>Gaze border just with Israel? Egypte doesnt border with Gaza?<br><br>Israel dont offer peace for so many time?<br><br>Israel dontest warn the Palstian before they start booming?<br><br>you told just one side of the story and with bad details shame on you
Absolutely diluted of truth and filled with distortions  and lack of context
every settler has rights to difend but Palestinein not..
This is discusting.  I stand with Palestine 🇵🇸
Dam I feel bad for Palestine
Finally, a video about Israel-Hamas war that don’t have people that comment “Free Palestine”.
Oh brother, I can&#39;t go 30 seconds without coming across some gravd factual inaccuracy. Israel in 67 did NOT launch an attack on Jordan or Syria out of fear of being attacked. Israel launched an attack because they WERE attacked, first, by those two countries. Egypt js the only country Israel preemptively struck.
The surrounding Arab countries did not declare war on Israel because of the influx of refugees. Their genocidal intentions towards the Jewish settlements were made known well before the UN declared the state of Israel.
No, it is NOT Israel that exclusively controls the borders with Gaza. The entire souther border is shared with Egypt. Singling out the Jews for the seige and ignoring Egypt (and recognizing that if both an Arab and Jewish state agree on the need for such a seige then perhaps there is some military necessity for it) is antisemitic.
It doesn&#39;t matter who is the real bad guy. The conflict is awful and both sides are suffering.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv1SpwwJEW8&amp;t=19">0:19</a> other user noticed this is a civil demolition. It is very inappropriate/manipulative to put this clip in this video.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Wow they’re both being let down by their own governments. What a surprise.
So full of misguided information.
I mean dont attack them if you dont want your citizens to get hurt.
And total ignore about the border with Egypt their &quot;brothers&quot; gosh
this will still be a thing in year 3034
Strange not to see one rocket fired from Gaza landing in Israel or an explanation as to why the border with Egypt is also closed. Seems like they are deliberately trying to mislead people which I can only assume is politically motivated. I think if we could first be honest, we may find peace.
It sold that Hamas are a terrorist organisation, but Israel have limited the lives of the people in Gaza, its no wonder that they will rise up and fight.
Hmm.. I wonder why would the evil Jewish State start to &quot;forcibly expell hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their land to establish the state of Israel&quot; in 1940s. I can only imagine the shock of people living in the peaceful Arab State when those unexpected Jewish attacks have started. Another interesting historic fact covered in this video is the only war in the history of humanity caused by countries being &quot;overwhelmed by refugees&quot;. My only hope is that European leaders will not declare war against Ukraine after watching this
this is very one sided
This all stems from colonialism,  religion and greed. If we didnt have religion we would be much more peaceful
So it’s basically district 12
انصح اخواني بقرأت القرآن
What Blockade? There is literally no Blockade.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🫒
This Channel is funded by HAMAS
Is this a one sided video. Yes.
The problem with a possible solution to this conflict is the Palestinian opposition to the very existence of Jews and Israel. If they are freed completely, they will try to wipe out the Jews immediately- that leaves nothing to negotiate for. The world can just sit n watch with no solution to this generic hatred in sight.
It’s disturbing how Gaza is pretty much a failing fallout shelter vault at this point :/
All the comments are being filtered. YouTube is starting to act like big brother
This is literally the most sympathetic video towards Palestinians. It doesn’t cover as much as it should. The full history.
Probably one of the worst Vox videos I’ve seen so far.  In the past their ‘Explained’ series generally used to be more detailed &amp; fairly objective.  However, in my opinion at least, this largely just comes off as an anti-Israeli, pro-Palestinian compassion piece.  <br><br>That’s not to say that their research in this video is wrong or that Israel is not to blame for anything, but way too much contextual information has either been left out or glossed over.<br><br>Also failed to mention how over the course of time Palestinian extremist groups including Hamas &amp; the PLO have entered or ‘claimed refuge’ within Arab countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait &amp; Iraq.  They then aligned themselves with rebellion movements &amp; started/supported multiple destabilising uprisings within their ‘Arab neighbours’ borders.  <br><br>Probably worth mentioning just one reason why Egypt &amp; co are refusing to accept any refugees in this latest crisis...
yeah leave it to arabs to tell you history lol
This is a very unbalanced view of events.
So basically they’re Muslim neighbors don’t want them either got it
Half truth is worse than a lie. You really disappointed Vox this time. You missed plenty of important details. Shame!
I don&#39;t know, seemed like pretty fair reporting to me......Said no one
Pray for Palestine 🇵🇸
Should have covered pre-2006 Israeli factors that influenced Hamas’ growth.
This is a very partial report, it leaves out important parts of history, and skews the facts.  For example the expulsion of Palestinians came after the Arab Invasion in 1948, not before, and Israel’s attack on Egypt came as a preemptive strike, after Nasser gathered thousands of troops on Israel’s border.
And people still say, this isn&#39;t an apartheid state 🤦‍♂️
Palestine rejected Britain’s suggestion for two state solution.   Palestine wants Jewish genocide.
My honest question is why are Gaza people dependent on Israel for food, electricity, clean water, basically essentials!!!?
Al-Sisi is guilty, Al-Sisi is a criminal with all the descriptions of crime, he and his cowardly regime, which not a day goes by without God humiliating them and disgracing them, and the last disgrace is here today coming from the International Tribunal in The Hague. Yes, it is true that Al-Sisi is the one who closes the Rafah crossing and starves an entire people. Al-Sisi and I will explain and confirm my words. Ok, Al-Sisi was not the one who closed the Refaa crossing, and it was the entity that was deliberately accusing him of this charge. Ok, Sisi, O Khasisi, stand up now and do the opposite? Open the crossing and let the aid pass. If not, as you claim, are you not the one closing the crossing? The entity’s words, and if this entity is something we do not trust, then its words and accusations against Sisi and his regime are completely true, because Sisi will not open the crossing even though the entity accuses him of closing it, and this is exactly what proves that Sisi is actually the one closing the crossing.
Gazans are basically Egyptian
Hold up, Israel is older than Palestine. Rome named Palestine.
Israel has not occupied Gaza since 2005.
wow this is a great break down of the topic thanks 🙏
Was never Palestine. It was Canaan, and the Kingdom of Israel @Vox
If Gaza once was Egypt controlled area why doesn’t Egypt open their borders?
From The River To The Sea Palestine will be FREE 🇵🇸
Free palestine , stop nakba
Youtube And Google think that showing such video and the reality of Israel terrorst is violent against their policy it means Youtube itself is terrorist
And what about the Egypt border crossing?
Why can’t Palestine figure out a way to live without Israel?

Wow this is unbelievable.. this is not journalism, this is proper lying and this will further peace away.<br>Vox should be ashamed. Every single fact is bent to the point of being a lie.<br>I used to like this channel. This video is the manifestation of evil.
Otoman &quot;rule&quot;<br>British &quot;occupation&quot;
Oh yeah. Let’s be sure to not mention that Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005 and it has been under the rule of Hamas by election since 2006. smh
Free Israel 🇮🇱
And still Israelis find all this justifiable and the murder of thousands is ok.
Israel don&#39;t you think you&#39;re getting to be a little too greedy trying to conquer so many things out of bullying people
Imagine a country done this to Israel,  the world would be in uproar.  This is absolutely shocking. Shame on anyone who is involved with the occupation.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
This video is totally pro-Palestine. They are saying militant bombings and Palestinian attacks in a casual manner. But when Israel is doing something then they are saying it with emphasis. Palestinians gave Israel no option. Whenever Israel is trying to have peace.. they are committing terrorism. What is Israel supposed to do in this situation? Why should it sacrifice itself for Palestinians. Also Hamas is using children as human shields and forcibly keeping them at places which have been issued warning by Israel. Just try to look at the actual picture of what is really happening instead of this one sided video
Vox failed to mention that jews were living there before the ottoman empire and the jees were expelled becsuse the ottoman conquered them
All the Palestinians had to do was not attack Israel, end of story!
The occupied has the right to resist apartheid occupation the actions of the apartheid occupiers isn’t due to Hamas as they were doing samething before Hamas and in non Hamas controlled areas so it’s due to their hatred of Palestinians
Free Palestine 🍉
We all know the truth.. and the world begins to see it too.. Palestine always been Palestine 🇵🇸
What is happening is unhuman, there needs to be more action more help is needed
Coba ibu Pinanti tolong  gasa jzionis tuh  haniskan
It goes back to 1948. Why did the Arabs not accept the 1948 UN proposals? Israel accepted them, but the Arabs declared war, 24 hours later. So from that day on, Israel had to defend itself. Judaism was 2000 years old. Islam was 2000 years later! You miss out facts.
😢😭😭
Thank you for the video&gt;
&quot;Historic Palestine&quot; never existed,but you guys won&#39;t care because misinformation is king for you
Can you update the death toll now? 1400 civilians is factually wrong. It was under 700 out to those 700 only God knows how many the IDF. Actually accidentally killed. Regardless death is horrible but facts need to be updated vox your better then this 😢.  Be fair.
Free Palestine ❤
God save the animals in Gaza. 🐷🐶🙊🐱
I feel bad for the animals in Gaza !!!
You put a siege on gaza fifteen years ago
Justice does not exist in the world. The only things that matter are guns and money. Israel has more of both, so they will win this conflict.
You have many of the facts correct but the reasons why and what led up to them are completely incorrect
Well I guess if someone come to your land and force you out and control everything! What you think going to happened ????
Palestinian Arabs fled the country AFTER the Arab countries declared war on Israel, not the other way round. You are skewing the facts.
&quot;The prime minister of the Israeli occupation&quot; &lt;--- that&#39;s an example of someone calling Israel itself occupied, as if it&#39;s not a country.<br><br>Also, way to gloss over a few decades of pogroms and bombings against Jews by Palestinian Arabs, like the 1929 Hebron pogrom and 1936-39 revolts that attacked Jewish towns.
Attack on titan
The sheer arrogance of the Israeli politicians is staggerring.
wiw😯<br><br>annu😯<br><br>boom😭
Very one-sided documentation. Not calling Hamas terrorists, but ‘militant groups’ and never explaining why Israel is doing what it does. If you elect a terrorist organisation as your leader, what exactly did you expect?
This title reflects our  “modern” world where powerful are the bad guys and at fault for the behaviors of other people. Not that Britain has clean hands but other people came to them. I’m sure they knew what they were asking for.  All sides.
Palestinian isn&#39;t even a thing these ppl are Arabs from Egypt 😂 Lmao
Does anyone know where I could find the original documentary without the censored footage?
Tell me again how Israel isn&#39;t a settler colonialist nationalist fascist state.
The lies about what is happening are being exposed every day about the land in Palestinian and its governing peoples, the European Jew. And now the Genocide thats being committed, while America and the European countries are in Condon and support it while looking the other way.
What charters, agreements etc. have the British or U.S. ever honoured
Ban Bombs i say! When did it become “OK” to blow men, women and children to smithereens? That is insane, barbaric, inhumane beyond words. It is sick. All disputes from now on should be settled with rational debate and objective evidence combined with a tolerance, compromise,  and compassion with the goal to find a win-win that brings peace, prosperity and justice to the world.
This documentary is wholly inaccurate and incomplete!
Jews were arabs
I appreciate knowing the history. Thank you.<br>I&#39;d like to say that the British were the catalyst, but the atrocities that have taken place by Israel since the 1948 Nakbha are on Israel and also the massive financial support from the USA.
IMHO, British did not started Arab Israel conflict, islamists started the conflict. British just take advantage of that and excuse themself to their own benefits.
THIS MOVIE PARTLY EXPLAINS HOW YOU BECAME A SLAVE TO ISRAEL.
AMERICAN EXTORTED TAX DOLLARS PAID FOR EVERYTHING IN PALESTINE, INCORECTLY CALLED ISRAEL. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OWN EVERYTHING THERE.
STALIN ARMED THE JEWISH TERRORIST,
SEE THE BALFOUR DECLARATION OF 1917,
Why is the British on the UN international?
The Bloody British,  it&#39;s offspring(America), the freaking pompous French...ITALY🤦🏿‍♀️!!!😤🤬 Shareef Hussein is to blame for this situation. If he had not opened the door for this lot to get in, the situation in the Middle East would not have happened. I firmly believe that. My opinion, the Jewish occupation is being used as a catalyst to finally once and for all get control of that region.
Why there are no names of the experts/historians?
Who were the Jews, who were the Arabs and who were the Palestinian? Does it means that this documentary also is corrupt??
This short film of properly bundled up men shows only two men with gloves and not one hand is inside a pocket.  Stunning collection of film!  Congratulations!
The immediate recognition by USA of the self-proclaimed state of Israel without any recognition of Palestinian rights should also be questioned.
With a bit of knowledge of history it would show the nonsense around this issue that passes for fact. The real culprits are the Turks. They sided with Germany in WW1, so when they lost, the decision about what to do with that region fell to the British and the French. <br><br>Try telling this story of the Middle East in the scenario where Germany, and its ally Turkey, won. Then whose fault would the current mess be attributed to? Too hard?<br><br>But so much simpler and convenient to say it is ALL the fault of Britain. Just that. Convenient. Lazy thinking and poor history.
Thank you for  this Library.
So capitalism and British imperialist bastardry has led to the genocide of Gazans today. 😢
Israel government is controlled by  British and Americans. <br>It&#39;s at war now to gain access to the turky and Iran and so on <br>It&#39;s all plane .<br>It&#39;s business for them.<br>Human lives doesn&#39;t have any value. <br>So much killing of incent children and women. <br>And starvation displament .<br>Sooo sad
British wanted Iraqi oile and controls of Suez canal which is near philistines. <br>So they used the Jews name to forme a state Israel. <br>And transport the oils British needed a state where it has access to the sea which was created state Israel. <br>It&#39;s all about British politics and <br>Control of other nations Land for itself. <br>Like it did in India. <br>And many more countries over the centuries.
From 1878-1948 The British put the Hebrews into captivity (70yrs). The Hebrews went against Gods Covenant with their circumcision. Galatians 3:10-12, 5:1-3 and was 2 Peter 2:19-22 notice; in verse 2 peter 2:20 it is the later end, which comes before the very end. Now the British which still have possession of Israel with their British Jews, are now after the Catholics killing and destroying them and killing the people of America to overtake America and give it to P.H. Just as they came here and killed the Indians with disease and cutting off their food and supplies, they back again doing the same thing putting blame on China (which I&#39;m sure are helping along with many other countries) God bless Now you might understand Daniel 12:1
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸✌️✌️✌️
Britain didn&#39;t start this conflict, the Arab armies invaded in the 7th century and have caused problems in the land ever since.<br>Islam is the ongoing problem... with sources that tell muslims to fight, kill and subjugate, like Surah 9.29 and the writings of things Mohammed said which call for violence against Jews and Christians.<br>This video only gives a snippet of political life of the Holy Land, so you can&#39;t solely put the blame for conflict on the powers that won WW1 and WW2
This is a prime example of what it means to make deals with the devil. Instead of standing up for your brothers and sisters you sold them all out and now you are all being asked to sell them out again - without their input or knowledge. <br><br>It’s time to end this and stop the western imperialist powers once and for all. After all they have zero respect for anyone - not even their own citizens. They’d all sell their own mothers for 30 prices of silver!<br><br>“What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive”.<br>                            Walter Scott
It was never about the hostages , it was ALWAYS about land grab.
So everything is Britains fault, that&#39;s played out, no one else has ever done anything wrong or started wars right 🙄
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXfuqUhzESg&amp;t=2920">48:40</a> what about the u.s.a.? Britain wouldnt have had any of this position if not for this country on the otherside of the atlantic.
Great documentary.  Thx
Absolutely true!  WATCH what God will do if you want to see something interesting.🐑
I am beginning to ask whether or not that is really true.  There is a huge big case of treason going on right this very minute!🐑
But of course, Jordan belongs to the Israelites.🐑💓
I am sorry to say that that particular piece of land belongs to the Great God Almighty snd he loves and thinks about every day.<br><br>That Israel had to do incredible acts before God to gain that land is well written in the bible history book.  Because God made the Israelites his special people for His own purposes has been believed for centuries.  So, dear hearts, what do you think is going on now.<br><br>There is no such thing as a two-state solution.  That is something America has trumped up because they do not know the ancient history of that piece of land, or they know it and think they can outsmart God.  Good luck on that one!💓🐑
One thing I do know is that the devil is busy trying to confuse us all that he might get to own the earth.<br><br>To me the church has fallen away.  Therefore what I have learned about Israel may or may not be true.  The Jews came back to its land in 1948 thru the Balfour agreement.  Jesus inferred that the fig tree is Israel and when we see it bloom, we are the generation <br>That will see wrath.  As some people say now, I Say, &quot;I know nothing&quot;. However, I do think that in these days we are led by what Jesus Christ tells us as written in Hebrews.  And, of course we might surely believe that all Israel will be saved when the redeemer comes and takes away their sins and they will be grafted back into the fig tree as stated in Romans.<br><br>It is too bad, that the church does not engage in serious discussion with its congregants rather than having a human preacher stand in front of us and tell us what to believe.<br><br>Perhaps the church will change it&#39;s ways?<br><br>I do know there is only one living God who has a Son, Jesus Christ, both of whom we ought to love forever and praise, and we ought to love our neighbor as ourselves.🐑💓. In addition, the Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit will lead us into all truth.  What do you think?🐑
it is  100% certain that had Israel not been created., Muslims would have tried to drive all Jews into the sea. There is absolutely no doubt that would have happened. Only the creation of Israel prevented genocide.
Fantastic interview with a British old war monger: he had no sensible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXfuqUhzESg">0:00</a> answers to give the world! This British guy went away more educated in his hole career 🙏
If we all sing, you can get anything you want at Alice’s restaurant
This war between Arabs and Jews was planned and excited by their british.the could have created one unified state called.
Wherever the British go. It&#39;s chaos and they stab you in the back. They can&#39;t be trusted.
💔💔💔
The British Empire was the root of all evil.. They have always subjugated people of color. How could the Arabs think it would support them!
The British Empire is the root of many evil history around the world.  Why doesn&#39;t Europe take back those zioNst?!!
High school and endocrine system Web Host system Web steering home land security system of the world
Divide and conquer is imperialistic strategy.  Its been done in latin america, africa, and Asia.    The “great” powers are guilty of Palestine’s active  genocide.
U S A becomes a nation by the help of the people of Israel.  Nobody knows it. Research it.  God says, blessings to those who bless Israel. Curses to those who cursed Israel.<br>2024, Israel is a rock to the world. Nobody could overturned it. Nobody could get it from Israel!,.,..
America is to blame, the British didn&#39;t have much choice but to comply.
The Jews were in the middle east when Britain was still a hunter gatherer society. Yes the British Empire tried to give the Jewish community a country to call their own. If they had not, the middle east would still be a constant raging war. Not everything is as simple as blaming a single party. Did the British start the Houthi&#39;s or the multiple differnt versions of the Muslim faith?
This should be required history class in all public schools in America.... All of this was omitted from my public education from 1978-1990. In 1902, Jews lived in historic Palestine but their numbers were very small, the area was inhabited mostly by Arabs Christian, and other groups of people, but everyone lived together Peacefully !!!
Britain had no right to give Palestinian land to Israel...Palestinians should sue Britain the blunder.
Great documentary, but until today has not solved the problems in Palestine. Although now everyone knows whose the culprit is.
You’re completely wrong on this. The UN decided that Jews could have a part of Trans Jordan, that the British and French had carved up under the Sykes - Picot Agreement.  At the time, the member states of the UN had voted for that decision.  Go read some books, get your eyes off social media bias.
That’s the way it was true. People make choices. Everybody’s looking for someone to blame, try looking at it Islam.
who smart?<br>not pigs
I think what people forget is that when you go to war and you lose…people take your stuff. The Ottoman Empire decided to fight with Germany. They lost against England and America. They lost land as a result. That’s the way it is. <br>The reason why The entire Gaza Strip and Westbank is not Israel is because Israel lost the war against the Babylonians in 607BCE. Babylon took it. Then the Medo-Persians took it, then the Greeks, then the Romas finally destroyed Jewish Jerusalem in 70CE. <br>These are the facts, read your history. <br> After the fall of the Ottoman Empire a small piece was given to the Jews. They are there to stay. <br>Get over it.
It&#39;s always British fault
China never colonized any country yet they are hated more than colonizers
This mention of Palestinian, and Palestinian nationhood, is completely fabricated. The parts on Arab nationalism are true, but I really don&#39;t understand how they can have &quot;historians&quot; talking about a &quot;Palestinian&quot; nation named after &quot;its people&quot;, who are arab, when arabs did not want to be called Palestinian, the only people in Palestine called Palestinian were Jews. Distorting history is harmful to everyone involved, it gives false hope and perpetuates lies that lead to genocide. Everyone should take these subjects seriously.
Absolutely brilliantly made and fascinating documentary.
Great documentary, thank you. I just need to add two things, Churchill&#39;s speach at around 40min mark was a lot longer and a lot more damning, also his support for Jewish people was purely to upease Americans, and subsequently to enjoy their support during the 1st World war. Meddling never ends well, especially if no one asked for help, now it has sparked yet another war...
This just proves that the devil owns most of the world leaders <br>They sold their souls for thirty pieces of silver <br>Evil times
BRITISH LOOTED INDIA TO THE TUNE OF 50 TRILLION US DOLLARS WORTH EQUAL TO TODAYS MONEY OVER THE PERIOD OF 200 YEARS AND TORTURE OF INDIANS AND ALSO THE REASONS OF MASS GENOCIDE DURING PARTITION OF India during independence of India but hey now look at rich developed uk and poor developing india but still england is not willing to lodge a formal apology even with an Indian Hindu origin as its uk pm and nor does uk willing to pay back trillions of dollars looted from India including its kohinoor diamond on the crown of englands queen or princess whatever she may be 😢😮PARTITION OF INDIA INTO TWO WAS PUNISHED BY UK AND CURSED UPON INDIA TILL DATE IN FORM OF INDIA PAKISTAN CONFLICTS TILL DATE NOT TO FORGET ISSUE OF  KASHMIR AND PAKISTAN TERRORIST ATTACKING ON INDIA AND SEVERAL WARS FOUGHT
Britains attempt to thwart the Germans World War  left  the troubled  middle east  in turmoil ... but hey they won the war
Bin Daoud removed the Hashemites from there homeland, then the Palestinians stole it, Hing Hussain as managed to keep the peace.
The Brits always try to sanitize their history.
Gluttony by shareef ! We will remember this name .
Ridiculous,this conflict goes back to Isaac and Ishmael
lol rubbish. Arabs have been at the Jews for centuries. stop blaming western culture out of jealousy. its the best culture the planets seen to date.
I can see now why children are just taught superficial history like how many wives Henry VIII had. This actual history would make young minds question power structures and the parts our governments and corporates play in carving up the earth.
Crazy how not keeping your promises can lead to conflicts that span ages.
Look at the Balfour declaration and see who it’s addressed to and then look up that family and how they became in control of the British empires money
Britain has caused so much conflict around the world 😢 people are still suffering due to their historic actions
&quot;The Turks and Arabs&quot; @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXfuqUhzESg&amp;t=82">1:22</a>. I knew they were from Turkey. That&#39;s not really Israel in the Holy Land.<br>Genesis 9:25 And he said: Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 26 And he said: Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; and let Canaan be their servant. 27 God enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be their servant.
TheLeague of Nations asked the UK to administer the territory after WW1. The United Nations voted for Israel independence. That is a fact.
Brits gave stirred and conflicts throughout the countries they colonized.
It started when Britian made up the word Palestine
Oh really The British were around in Biblical times?   Abraham &amp; all that?
And Britain is being &#39;invaded&#39; by the descendants of the people they mistreated which is 😂<br><br>Love it.
Did Britain started the dud
Was Britain founded / exist  at the start of the Arab Israel conflict ?
History is a conjunction of two words, his -story. Please me mindful of this definition as you watch this video, while there are many truths in the video it&#39;s also has a narrative to promote. I am not a historian so I am always leery of the documentaries that I watch to make sure that I am not getting fed a skewed narrative. For example, at minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXfuqUhzESg&amp;t=2875">47:55</a> Youssef Choueiri falsely states that Palestine was named after the Palestinians, ie the Arabs living in that region. &quot;In the early 2nd century CE, the term &quot;Syria Palaestina&quot; (literally, &quot;Palestinian Syria&quot;) was given to a Roman province incorporating Judaea and other territories, either before or after the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135.&quot; The Romans called the area Palaestina in an attempt to obliterate the Jewish history and Identity of the area which was had been known as Judea and Samaria. Prior to 1948 all inhabitants, Jews, Arabs and Christians, of this area were referred to as Palestinians.<br> The Jews were a minority in Palestine prior to 1948 because Jews there are very few Jews in the world. Most people are unaware that there are only 15.7 million Jews in the world and 1.8 billion Muslims. There are also 22 Arabs nationalist or states in the world and only one tiny Jewish state. There are some Jews, not unlike the Samaritans, that have never left the land of Israel since biblical times others have assimilated into the Arab population or were expelled from the land to wander the earth and face persecution. <br>   I would also caution viewers that this documentary cherry picked their historians to support a specific narrative. For example, Avi Shlaim is part of a group of called the &quot;New Historians&quot; of Israel. Perhaps revisionist historians is too strong a term, but it&#39;s safe to say that this group challenges traditional versions of Israeli history, which is fine as long as viewers are aware that they are getting a one sided representation from a member of the New Historians. My point is that Israeli history is very nuanced and the shades of gray are easily lost to those who are unfamiliar with the polemics that can masquerade as facts. <br> The following is what I gleaned from this documentary, the Arabs represented by Hussein bin Ali, King of Hejaz, Faisal and other Pan Arab nationalist sided with Britain in a gamble to overthrow the Ottoman empire and gain Pan Arab Nationalism and self determination. The British and French carved up Arabia into artificial countries based on the Sykes picot plan. <br>  I can imagine that Suni Arab Hashemites had their rivals among the Arabs. In the end Jordan gained statehood Following agreement with Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill, the Emirate of Transjordan was established on 11 April 1921. The Arabs gamble worked out in the end as they ended up with 22 countries in the middle east even if Saddam Hussein didn&#39;t want to recognize the borders of kuwait because they were drawn up by the British!. The question is where do we go from here to get to peace in the middle east?
OK fine. What do we do now, from today. Blame is easy to assign, however, how can we rectify the present situation
Biblical Prophesy fulfilled. The Jews now have a state of their own.
It’s always the Brit’s fault
Totally agree. They have a lot to answer for ALL their crimes against humanity for centuries.
Brits are basically no.1 cause of all issues in world right now. Major ones. Look at them now, their economy is in gutters and they  have decimated with Brexit. Circle of life. Wales and Scotland want out too.
Britain is the secret or overt source of nearly all evils, and has been for hundreds of years.
Britain’s responsible for almost every conflict in the world if you really think about it
❤ it is written in the CHRISTIAN BIBLE that Jews will return back to their homeland. May 14, 1948 was the date when Israel became officially a nation. From USA.
Trust Snake but do not trust west
Britain indeed since hundreds of years ago wanted to take over Palestine but failed.. that is one of the reasons why Britain established the state of Israel and the goal is to prevent Palestine from becoming a recognized state..
Interesting spin on events. Bit of salt needed. Great footage though.
An interesting an account/history of how this conflict was birthed!
Very well presented. Thanks so much for this important educational video.
Many of british people are angry with what our goverment has done at the start and now.. they are responsible for this war. It seems they went to many countries causing grief and death. Bur god is watching and will make them pay

Apki information rong h
Pta ni kya cheez hai.... Thry have USA funding
You keep saying that the Jews killed Jesus but he actually died by the Roman&#39;s in their most common way, Jesus was arrested by the Jewish authorities, but crucified by the Roman governor. Therefore, both groups were involved in his death, but only one group had the power to do so. Since the Jews were governed by the Roman&#39;s and were afraid they will destroy the temple again. The reasons differ but the fact is he didn&#39;t die by their hands.
Israel ke pass bahut kunwari ladkiyan hai isliye vah
😂😂😂😂😂
Israel is a son of western countries and Americans to control oil of the Middle East.Actually western countries fight before with Arabian that is the main problem.
Britishers divided whole world
Abraham (AS) and Jesus (AS) taught the same thing, which is to worship one God.
UNBIASED 👌
Isreal win coz USA UK And Other state support isreal against Arab countries
Your information should be upgraded. Before 1948 there was no Israel.  This Isreal from a year known as Phalestine.  <br>And you must study of Islam then you know who was phrophet suleman and ibrahim . <br>For what purpose Suleman temple was built. <br>Regarding prophete Mohammad also and All deeply study of Miraj.

Nitish sir 7 39 pr jo document h usme Rothschild family ka naam h syed unke uper bhi ek video bnao na
Extremely vague informations at particular points. You should have mentioned how did such a newly formed  nation (israel) defended against all arab countries. You should have went in detail on what sort of support they had and the motive behind those supports.
Why is there a cutoff at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZBE5j2kIgY&amp;t=316">5:16</a> at the most important point ?
Courageous Israelis ❤
Sorry to say Brother, Jesus (Isa A.) didn’t make christian religious. He was for Jews (who/whom were believed in Allah). Even Masjid-Ul-Aqsa was there before the Umar (R.) attack...

اسلام ایک امن پرست مذہب ہے اور یہ یہودی دہشتگرد ہیں  ہیں اس لیے یہ جیت جا رہا ہے ہم ہر انسان کا قدر کرتے ہیں نہیں تو ہم بھی یہودیوں کی طرح ظالم ہو تو ایک بھی یہودی نہیں بچے گا
Islam is a pacifist religion and these Jews are terrorists, so it is winning. We value every human being. Otherwise, if we are cruel like the Jews, there will not be a single Jew left.
❤❤❤❤❤
Your content needs correction<br>All the viewers! &quot;The king solomon&quot; was not a &quot;jew&quot;, He was a prophet of Allah almighty and his name was &quot;Hazrat Suleman AS&quot;  and the &quot;Mount temple&#39;s&quot;or&quot; First&quot;or&quot;Second Temple&#39;s &quot;Real name was &quot;Takht_e_Sulemani&quot;
Why the video is cutted at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZBE5j2kIgY&amp;t=303">5:03</a> . Anyone knows what is told here?
I&#39;m not sure but wasn&#39;t it a roman king ig pontius pilate who killed Jesus since he was consider a threat to the ruling empire but later while the Christianity was yk... like adopted by the romans the blame was shifted to jews to keep peace in the empire...?!?
Godse Jindabad❤
Verses From The Holy Quran <br>An-Nissa 4:155-165<br><br>˹They were condemned˺ for breaking their covenant, rejecting Allah’s signs, killing the prophets unjustly, and for saying, “Our hearts are unreceptive!”—it is Allah Who has sealed their hearts for their disbelief, so they do not believe except for a few and for their denial and outrageous accusation against Mary and for boasting, “We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” But they neither killed nor crucified him—it was only made to appear so. Even those who argue for this ˹crucifixion˺ are in doubt. They have no knowledge whatsoever—only making assumptions. They certainly did not kill him.<br>Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.<br>Every one of the People of the Book will definitely believe in him before his death. And on the Day of Judgment Jesus will be a witness against them.<br>We forbade the Jews certain foods that had been lawful to them for their wrongdoing, and for hindering many from the Way of Allah taking <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23interest">#interest</a> despite its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23prohibition">#prohibition</a>, and consuming people’s wealth unjustly. We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.<br>But those with solid knowledge among them and those with true faith believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and what was revealed before you—˹especially˺ those who establish prayer—and those who pay alms-tax and believe in Allah and the Last Day, to these ˹people˺ We will grant a great reward.<br>Indeed, We have sent revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ as We sent revelation to Noah and the prophets after him. We also sent revelation to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants, ˹as well as˺ Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon. And to David We gave the Psalms. There are messengers whose stories We have told you already and others We have not. And to Moses Allah spoke directly.<br>˹All were˺ messengers delivering good news and warnings so humanity should have no excuse before Allah after ˹the coming of˺ the messengers. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.
Israel being the m f s they are.

Free Palestine
Hi bro is ka 2 park batao na jo abhi ke halat hai ..
Israel won because the US and Britain supported them. Israel always wins because these two countries provide financial, reinforcement, and all kinds of support.
Jews were living peacefully under muslim leaders... So where did the problem start?
&quot;Palestine arbabo ka hai , jaise england English ka ai aur france french logo ka &quot;, Mahatma Gandhi, par hindistan kiska hai ye nahi bataya apane ?

This is a very one sided argument missing key facts and misleading no mention of the Nakbha and that Palestinians where dispelled from there lands in the millions. Briton did the same thing to India with the partion of Pakistan and Kashmir which we say is unfair but what they did in Palestine is just as bad. I stand with humanity always I support the people of Palestine to have rights and freedom as every human being deserves
You should make this video to give some good messege but for the sake of muslim likes you just fucked up the video
Those who support israel should give them their land. Period

Here u r wrong, Jesus didn&#39;t teach anything DIFFERENT from Judaism, Infact He taught original things from Solemen and Moses i. e Judaism found in Torah Old Bible. At that time the priests of Judaism were very corrupted and they conspired to kill Jesus, by blaming that Jesus is claiming He is God. Jesus was taken up alive by Allah, and He will return on the earth before Doom Day. Those who loved Jesus and cried for Him, were called Christians. Fundamentally Christians are enemy of Jews, because Jews are killers of Jesus. Solemen, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad are all prophets of God. Pls do research and u will realize that those Jews who involved in corruption, they were the ones who killed majority of saints, prophets, Yahya Prophet, Zakariya Prophet, Jesus, and even blamed sanctity of Hazrat Mary peace be upon her, and they were never happy to see greatest miracles of Moses peace be upon Him. These Jews (only corrupted ones) were even involved in killing of Muslims, battle of Badr, and conspiracies leading to killing of ALL progney of Muhammad Peace be upon Him in Karbala Iraq.

America, Israel, these two are the biggest terrorists in the world, these two scoundrels only see money, they are the murderers of millions of innocent lives.
King solomon wasn&#39;t a jew.he was a believer of prophet moses and His one God and believed on the arrival of one Last prophet of God (muhammad pbuh). They were instead known as BANI ISRAEL ( sons of Israel, Israel was actually the other name of prophet yakoob pbuh). Same is with the belief of jesus christ, he also was a monotheistic believer of God and believed on teachings of prophet moses and on the arrival of one Last prophet (muhammad pbuh) whose teachings will be valid till the end of time and is applicable on all humanity. They all shared the Same religion of one Allah almighty. So there was no concept of separate Jewish   Christianity as&#39; religion &#39; on prophets level These were man made differences continued to be made in all eras of time. Nitish plz correct and again have an authentic historical and theological review on this topic as information narrated is theologically incorrect. Thanks
Nitish bhai apne jesus ko galat explain kiya hai jesus wo Islamic hai aur wo Isa (A.S) hai

Mention about nakba
You need to check how unjustified was the Palestine division done by UN for the formation Israel
Npc on their way to comment &#39; Free Palestine&#39;🤡
Israel does not have capacity to get ght against arabs without USA&#39;s Help<br>Even usa helped them to make them nuclear state
i am a pakistani but india has truly been a great nation by supporting palestine in this matter.
I don&#39;t understand why people favor palestine without knowing the full history.

Moving the embassy is controversial, breaking with decades of official US policy — and it comes at a particularly tumultuous time for Israel and the region. Read more on <a href="http://vox.com/">Vox.com</a>: <a href="http://bit.ly/2k3pFIE">http://bit.ly/2k3pFIE</a>
Please inform someone found ark of the covenant 🙏 thank you
This adds alot of context to the current conflict.
geopoliticals
It has always been the capital of Israel. It has never been the capital of anything arab ever!
Itu masjid kan. Jadi islam punya la. Nak argue apa lagi.
It&#39;s a good city
what matters is who owned the land at the time, and who stole it. If you use thousands of years of history as a basis for land ownership, then Americans are required to leave their homes now because Americans&#39; land belongs to the Indians. they were there before the Europeans came. Apart from that, Europe has a long history as a land of pagan people in the past, so they have more rights to this land... Are religions other than pagans willing to leave Europe?
The golden dome of Al-aqsa mosque built over the Herod&#39;s temple basemement, It is the BEST proof of the false palestine Fairy tale.
Show me where this is written in your Quran please 🙏? Jesus entered Jerusalem on a donkey , Mohammed flew in with a horse 🤣🤣 Jesus ascended into heaven Mohammed did the same ! If this isn’t a copy cat 🐈 man I don’t know what else😂
But the Jewish people had their temple there way before the arabs were named palestinians and a long, long time before islam was created ! So historical fact point to Jerusalem is the capital of the jewish state Israel.  Jews were there for milenia befor their ancestral land was declared the sovereign.
If we go by pure history, it belongs to the Jews, does it not? We’re talking pre 1000BCE
You started with isreal controlling west Jerusalem 🤨 palestine is palestine
Jerusalem is not mecca
The question is why is Israel occupying the other half and inciting violence while everyone pretends they are innocent
Esrael Name are politically The true name of the country are Palestine no Esrael name country in Past History map they just used the name of esrael .Esrael name is a name of Person not Country..And people think they are religious Until they occupied Palestine and used the name esrael.<br>The true owner of Zerussalem are Palestine people because zews are only Migrant people they migrant to The land of Palestine because The Germany leader name Hitler are they Killed the zews..
There is another problem that is u both are on Christian land God&#39;s Mt,  Jesus will be back and then u will run for your lives
Jerusalem was build by King David in 1000BC. Gods given land to israel forever.Nobody can go against Gods word
European powers carved up the Ottoman empire without asking the Nomadic People that lived there.
Palestinians had a country there, Israel invaded.
That last line couldn&#39;t be more relevant in 2023.
I wish they all know that Jerusalem is no longer a holy place...... After Jesus died the agreement btw God and Israel ended....instead our body is the only holy temple of God..the truth will always set us free
Why do arabs make the journey to mecca?
Bushit don’t listen to this
Thanks :)
its all because of relegion this jerusalem is the center of all conflict
Excellent video
BB m
احنا عندنا الناس واقفين فى الزمن مش واخدين بالهم. إن القدس بقت رسمى عاصمة اسرائيل كا عدا عندنا 😅😅😅
There&#39;s no such thing as Palestine....these people are just Syrian Arabs for the most part...some Egyptian and Iraqi Arabs...I love the ignorance of the media on well documented history
Al aksa, a robbery on temple mount by Islamic intruders.
well regardless its a fact Jews did found the sity the Mosque is built on top of a old temle mound.... dont have to be a genius to understand whos the &#39;&#39;native&#39;&#39;....
Palestinians dont want to make east Jerusalem their capital they want Jerusalem as theyre capital
Hopefully Jerusalem will be fully restored to Israel
As always.. religion the root problem of conflict 🙄
Half it or share it 🤯🤯🤯
that is not a holy land that is a curse land
Muhammad isn&#39;t in heaven <br><br>(Revelation 20:10) “And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented
So this is why Israel and Palestine is at war : The conquest for Jerusalem
There is nothing holy about this place anymore.
Jerusalem is not mentioned even once in the Quran. It&#39;s however the centerpiece of all Jewish faith.
The solution is for Jerusalem to be an independent city state.
Tell the  truth, Palestinians only want their state, who wants Jerusalem are the muslims! The plan is to eliminate all Palestinians and claim the land, disavowing other arabs! All can live there, only under Israeli rule!
Jerusalem belonged to Bnei-Yisrael before 950 B.C. During which time was the completion of King Solomon’s Temple built according to the instructions given by Adonai Elohim… so roughly 1600 years before Islam…
Respect the religious places  not   too much  u r 🙀🐀
jerusalem has been jewish for 3500 years, trump recoggnized that, simple
Favourite place for 3 difference gods. Not interested to be in other places on earth.
&quot;For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.&quot; Psalms 48:14 KJV ... We understand that God cares for us more than we will ever know. He rejoices with us in moments of happiness; His heart breaks with us in times of sorrow. He is present during good times and bad. Our lives are His treasure. He loves us when we are unloveable and forgives us when unforgivable. God is the same from beginning to end. He is consistent, reliable, and loves us unconditionally. ...  Our Father in Heaven, You remain devoted to us all the days of our life. Thank You for Your eternal presence and everlasting love.  In Jesus&#39; Name, Ame
It&#39;s called Al quds.
Did Abraham claim this land for Jews or not? According to the Bible?
The only party bringing violence in Palestine  is the occupation force that has disrupted the peace of Palestinians from 1948.
Without a doubt its Palestinians&#39;
religion has been the root of wars through history, Jerusalem is important to Israel Palestine and Christens so if it is claimed by any it will lead to conflict, so it should never have been a place of politics
Informative! I think based on this, Israel, in the name of peace, should give Jerusalem back to the future state of Palestine. It means more that a messiah ascended to Heaven, than old building locations. Christ knew those buildings could be trouble, if only he didn&#39;t listen to his brother James to allow it to stand. 🙏🕊️🇮🇱🇯🇴
Every time these two decide to blow each other up, the algorithm recommends this video. Honestly, that is best example of the algorithm doing its job.
Jerusalem is a cursed place.
Such chaos in a holy land what would god say maybe get along dont be violent
I noticed a pattern here,,,always fewer Israelis are killed and always triple that number for Palestines
Meanwhile the Christians are just there spectating this beef while everyone kinda forgets they&#39;re there
Jelusalem is jewish 100%
I only agree with a video if it fits my narrative
JERUSALEM IS A DO NOT TOUCH . THIS PLACE IS FOR NOBODY. IT IS ONLY FOR GOD. TOUCH NOT JERUSALEM. LOOK AND LEAVE AND YOU SHALL LIVE. BOTH SHOULD HONOR THIS PLACE🤷‍♀️I AM THE ONLY OWNER SAYS THE LORD🙏
I dont know why the muslims are obsessed with jerusalem. It is a city made by the jews 3 times. Jerusalem is not even mentioned in the quran. Yet musims think they own the place.
Will this be the End now in 2023 ?
How did the Ottoman Empire got Israel in the first place? Yet no one complained that the Ottoman Empire was wrong in Occupying Israel in 1683 during the peak of the power of the Ottoman Empire which controlled the whole of middle east during that time.  during that time, only the Arabs and Muslims were the dominant occupiers in Israel.  The Ottoman Empire is the main cause of the diaspora of the Jews away from their homeland.  Now that the Ottoman Empire is gone and the present world powers are the USA, British and western  ( Christian) powers,  why is everyone complaining why the Jews are wrong in returning to their homeland in  Israel, after their diaspora for more than 500 years. If the Allied powers did not win the World War 1,  the Jews will still be scattered though out the world.  The jews returning to Israel is justified after centuries of waiting and praying.
It will always be Palestine 🇵🇸❤️
All these wars and killing over control of Jerusalem is pointless,  as if these Barbarians could ever get into heaven. Both sides are condemned to eternal damnation for how they disregard human life.
Jeru-saleem.it&#39;s both theirs.
Christians should take it all from them
I’m sorry do they completely ignore the fact that they built there mosque over Solomons Temple
Well isn’t Jerusalem in Israel? It’s like USA claiming Guadalajara because of religion aspect
JERUSALEM BELONGS TO ISRAEL ... THAT IS THE TRUTH GODS WORD.
Unify. Like the Gaza?
So interesting- thx
This is an opportunity to allow the people of Palestine (all 6 million of them) to march to Iran where our Father gave them land thousands of years ago. I am a Levite Priest from the line of Ancient Israel. I love both the people of Israel and of Palestine! Soon we will return home to Israel and unlike the Israel you see now we will share the light of our Father and guide the world to be a better place. all people are Yahweh&#39;s people and our Father in Heaven loves Israel as much as Palestine who Father also has a purpose for! Our Father has told me that and I will do everything for both Israel and Palestinian people! Palestine must leave Israel and go to Iran to an area where our Father gave to them thousands of years ago-- and we in America and also Israel must pay Iran to take them in or finance their way to get there and support them to build a city and survive. <br>All 6 million must leave Israel and help each other to travel -- America must buy their gasoline and provide food and water and tents.
Religion is the most powerfull destructive tool ..especially if you want to sell more weapons and boost your economy ..second are drugs ..if you want to reduce population ..
Did I just see a few people running and jumping over some praying people?
America is the cause of the problem. Favoring Israel is so despicable. No wonder Afghanistan chased the west and US out of their country.
It’s also an important worship location for Christians.
Anything trump believes is bound to be a bad idea.
Israel has benefited from American ignorance for far too long.

Deep Pockets
trump&#39;s signature is so funny
To be clear, Israel offered a great deal to Palestine and have Jerusalem under international control. Proposal was in 2008
Which Israel are we talking about?
Eng]and gave Palestine in 1928 after ww1 to the Jews. The Jews where a 8 percent minority compared to to Palestinians in Palestine. The Jews are taking the land by force and scam illegal documentation. Britain has created the hate between Arabs and Jews.
It has been Jewish land for around 3000 years - even if the Jews were expelled in between! Even after 1000 years, injustice does not become justice! What are Arabs doing in Holy Jerusalem and the other holy places of Christianity? Nothing at all;!
If the Palestinians new what a hammer and nail is for, maybe they could have a say in the matter.
Both claim???  1947 Israel  immgrant come from nowhere (holocaust people),claim tht land belong to them😂😂😂
Jerusalem was the capital of Israel long before there were ever any Muslims in existence to defile our world.    No matter how much the Palestinians continue to live in a delusional fantasy, Jerusalem is not up for discussion.
To summarise, Israel invaded and stole the lands from Palestine.
This is what you get when you make your own fan fiction of a religion that came first.<br><br>conflicts on holy lands.
Stop religion..its the problem..we are getting lied to...we all know that
Israel doesn&#39;t have any right in Palestine
My house will be called a house of prayer,&#39; but you are making it &#39;a den of robbers.
Correct the map of india
Religion is the root of all evil.
So is this all Trump’s fault?

There was only israeli land, Then kingdom of israel, no Palestinian land. I support neither. I just wanna say that palestine launched a missile at israel, october 7, and israel got wild in 1948,a small, tiny little israeli land started sending missiles to palestine, and i don&#39;t care if u spam &quot;free palestine, free israel&quot; In the comments, i just said facts.

Free Israel 🇮🇱
Pro pagemda goes crazy
That is the biggest bs I had ever seen 😂
Americans want to see happy Palestinian children but our politicians can&#39;t hear us over Israel money
What was their passport up to 1917? Who was their president/prime minister?... No nation no claim.... sympathy yes, but unless we understand that unorganized people anywhere in history have been subdued by stronger and better organised nations we will not solve the problem.
I live here in the U.S and i feel angry about what israel and the U.S has done also the uk
This is propaganda and it ignores what life has been like for the Jewish community. For example when the Palestinian mufti joined the SS and committed  an October 7th type raid against Jews living in Baghdad.
I&#39;m from Russia<br>Free Palestine❤
Allahu Akbar☪️🇵🇸❤️✌️
Может в этом виновата Палестина?

We don’t do anything for my brother. Shame for muslim world
JESHUA KING of Kings &amp; LORD od Lords is POISED to ACT toward the situation in His HOLY LAND such as those of us who read the Bible have ONLY read of. Then ALL will recognize that the Citizens of Plastine are the decendents of the ANCIENT PATRIARCH ABRAHAM. And that Palastine is their land FIRST before Israel was taken by the Russians seeking a homeland.
Never forget  Bucha. On 16 May 2022, BBC News reported that more than 1,000 civilians were killed in the Bucha region during the month under Russian occupation; most did not die from shrapnel or shelling. More than 650 were shot dead by Russian soldiers. Source: Wikipedia
Russia should be banned from any submissions talking about Palestinian people as it does the same to Ukrainian people, as we speak now. Get out of Ukraine land, Putler. Both Ukraine and Palestine gave right to be invasion free on their land.
Russia should worry about its own vicious cycle of attacking its neighbours, they still havent given the Habomai, Shikotan, Kunashiri and Etorofu islands back to Japan so they don&#39;t get to talk about occupation. Clowns. I love how the Arab world thinks Russia is on their side, so gulliable, they see the middle east as a tool nothing else.
F..k Americahelfair and Israhelfiar +Europeahelfair
Yes send chosen ones some chosen planets, Earth for Humans and all of us equally deserved to be in peace and free! If one says he is defending another one has same right to defend!!!!
HOLOCUST GOING ON  IN PALESTINE  , ONLY STUPIDI LEADERS WHO CANT SEE WHAT IT IS HAPPENING , STOP GENOCIDE IN GAZA.     YOU WILL NEVER SEE PEACE WITH YOUR DOUBLE CITIZEN.    STOP HOLOCUST NOW
US is the mother of all evils around the world
US  is no longer the protector of democracy. <br>US is the source of all evil causes and # 1 terrorist state
Who the real occupier  Palestine or Israel
Thank you Russia!
Many people all over the world are wondering whether Israel as the unofficial 51st state of the US is giving orders to the US government.
The WORLD HATES ISRAEL!
Who should get there security need for filled first, israil doing the mass bombing of an entire population or the population that’s been long bombed every second as I speech. America such a joke, psychopaths are running that country. They present them self as a moral defender of human rights, rules base order etc yet there action contradict them self. Only money and political influence are there concern not the people that are suffering as a result of American and its proxy israil pursuit of monitory  interests.
The USA and ICJ is controlled and influenced by Israel. The USA and ICJ lost and bowed to Zionist Jew Rothschild&#39;s money. The Rothschild family built Israel and the USA&#39;s central Bank.
Security of an occupier is more important than the occupied!!!😮 West has never served justice to the world citizens. It&#39;s not their art of living.
Il poblema e che in America politica ce troppi topi di fogna e corrotti.😮
ISRAEL IS NOT A NATION BUT A CRIMINAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT INTENDED &amp; COMMITTING GENOCIDE AND ETHNIC CLEANSING. US &amp; BRITAIN, ARE RUGUE IMPERIALIST NATIONS ARE COMPLICIT TO COMMIT GENOCIDE.
Pot meet kettle.
Russia? Hahaha
The hybrid albion European is pathologically incurable. 🙊🙉🙈🦁👁️
Go back US Israel from  MiddleEast,You have created catastrophy after catastrophy. Let that part of World have Peace.
The safety of the Israelis is to transfer them all to the US! They can live in Biden&#39;s house or the White House!
Shame on US government
SHAME ON US!
Russia and Iran put justice to shame because they have their share of violation of human rights and killing
This is the world court of justice, it must not discriminate against any citizens of the world period. Israel security must depend upon ending the illegal occupation. Justice for all, no country should be above the international laws, must not favor one country over another country. The international court of justice must be independent and free of any favoritism.
Says the representative whose murderous assassin invaded a sovereign country
ISRAEL SHOULD BE MOVED TO THE US !!!
Israel Bought Veto off the corrupt Leaders its F@kin CRIMINAL 👿
EVICT THE DEMON STATE OF ISRAEL OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST NOW👿
Israel should be dissolved and Arabs and Jews should live in a single binational state with equal rights on all its citizens.
Icj is just a puppet for usa , uk and israel <br> Shame on all of them <br> Its time the people tskes this in their hands. Now
Russia is a joke on the world stage.
When our land was occupied by the British, our forefathers fought for independence too. Our forefathers were not terrorists. They are our heroes. So do you Palestinians❤🇵🇸💪. Stay strong!
It seems to me now, Americans have to free themselves from Israel as the Palestinians try to free themselves from Israel too.
shame on the US🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
人不知他人（它方）之事，故自当各归安息！<br>维公義，守法制，人人平等，天下一律！<br>舆论按不实鼓动，心灵凭正直而行。<br>俄—乌战争，哈—以战事，伤亡悬殊巨大，却是为何，「势态」如此不同？！
Russia is good. Usa bad
Russia has a lot more honour and credibility than the UK or USA government.
so basically only Yemen took real action
Israel should leave and go back to Europe
The USA talking about the security of Israel, is he joking? Israel as we all know it is not in any danger, Palestinians are, so, lets no forget that. This court in order to be credible must do the right thing which is long overdue and guarantee the Freedom, The Right  to Self Determination and their own Sovereign State for Palestinians. This is the only solution for a lasting Peace. This Court Must make the wrong of the past Right and not allow this Court to be bullied by the USA and other countries complicit in the Genocide in Gaza and the constant intimidation even murders of Palestinians in the West Bank by Israeli Settlers. This madness must stop. The Palestinians deserve better.The World desrves better. Lets make Israel once and for all to abide by the decitions of the International Court. Peace.
Shame on USA, they disgust me
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
So the whole world is wrong, just the US and Israel are correct 🙄
Laughable that Russia speaks out for human rights when they&#39;re conducting their own genocide in Ukraine. What a joke.<br><br>My heart breaks for the Palestinian people suffering in Gaza, but let&#39;s not turn a blind eye to the suffering going on elsewhere too, especially under Russia and China.
Thought ICJ was already judging Russia by its war crimes in Ucraine.
usa shd be boycotted not israel only, if everyone stops talking with them they keep their banking system their master card their facebook, completely disconnected lets see how long they survive with ll their tech and companies inside of usa
established principles of occupation hahaha usa has principle for occupation aaah
During his speech,american lawyer&#39;s mouth was bone dry and nobody offered him water,this is bad manners.😊.<br>Except communist world,everyome knows who actually are hamas and hezbollah etc and why hamas was used and then gaza was desteoyed,so trying for a ceasefire is nonsense because everyone knows their efforts will go wasted,when something else similar will be done again,so no one is trying to stop it.everyone is watching and examining and just letting this all happen.and everyone is studying this case and also how far the thugs will take their false flag and what is their actual nature and how they first blame others and then how far they go.what are their moral values and limits etc etc etc.<br>Well let&#39;s come to the point.russia has stepped in and this is same as africans are doing.this will not lead anywhere.this is just a distraction and diplomatic damages to the westeren world.<br>Everything happening is well documented and every move of the is carefully studied,they are displayimg all their cards and most of them are like elephant tusks,just show pieces and pratically not effective or use able.they actually have very limited cards that they actually can play but there is a catch,if they will play them,they will have direct reactions without any care.which means they will be putting them at the stake if they will play them.<br>This all has become a mess for them and the goal behind this false flag has not been achieved.they have created countless problems for themselves instead.
Why is the USA are even allowed to speak at this hearing, especially to bring threats and influence the judges, to defend an apartheid state? They have to stay out of it.
O America......so low
So according to the U.S. Isreal’s security concerns aren’t being addressed? What about Palestinian’s security concerns? Look at the death toll between the two countries, way more Palestinians are killed every year. They are harassed, their homes and land taken by white settlers. And not to mention the ‘mowing of the lawn’ in Gaza that is carried out every so often. When do we get security for the Palestinians addressed?
If Israel can colonize independent Palestine 🇵🇸 then is not a war crime for Russia to colonize Ukraine fair it depends on who win the war good luck to Ukraine🫡
I mean who is Isreal to say whether or not Palestine should be another country? Based on this logic US has a border crisis so they should invade and occupy Mexico because who knows who is coming through the border?
Russia can annex ukraines land yet come to the UN with ideas about others and how they should live.. You gotta love it...
BOYCOTTS =WORKS MIRACLES, U SHOULD TRY IT.
I wonder why? The US doesn’t want a  Ceasefire shame on the Yankees
Hats off to those who support Palestine 🇵🇸🍉👍✌️🙏❤️🇮🇳
Boycott USA
Только Россия достаточно сильна, чтобы спасти Газу и Палестину.<br>Отказ России признавать Израиль стал бы первым шагом перед реальными действиями на местах. . .
USA is war criminal
Did you know that russia is going to be a moslem majority country within 30 years?
They will never be Palestinian state.
Jesus is coming very soon.
Международный Суд давном давно дольжен быль принять решение,о выводе всех амерканских войск из ближнего востока и с Украины, так как эти все войны устроенно амерканскими властьями, чтобы им продать свою оружию, если амерканские властьи не воружаль бы Украину и Израиль и не распродаль бы свои оружию на лего на право никакой войны не быль бы ни на Украине ни в Израилье с Хамазом и вообще не быль бы война на землье.Вес Мир видить как нагльо америка воружаеть Украину и Израиль,и по вине их погибаеть миллионами совсем ни в чем не винные люди, и никто не можеть какую то амерканских войск выгнать из всех стран Мира, нахира нам нужен амерканская демократия такая, которая натравльяеть одну страну на другое, а потом пихаеть им свои оружию, они на войне наживаеться, а простой народ погибаеть по вине их.Международный Суд если не в силе исправиться с амерканской мафии, тогда давай назначим Призидента Сев Корейи Ким Чен Ына Призидентом Мира, и тогда я на 1000% уверен, амерканские войска в течени часа убежить из ближнего востока, как Армяны из Карабаха.
Free Palestine
Demands of Israeli thieves are just absurd on the face of the humanity. We know how Israel lies.
Us is not a democracy nation and stop labelling other as terrorising
U.S history started only on October 7. The 75 years of occupation and abuse that part of history didn&#39;t existed.
Occupied Palestine 🇵🇸 is not only East Jerusalem,  the West Bank,  and Gaza,  but the whole of Palestine,  from the river to the sea 🇵🇸
Dictatorship is more instrumental powerful than any it&#39;s not a really  ICC leave the lawyer to take time not forceful
No justice in the world
That is the reason we empathize with Russia. They stand for fairness on several key matters of international interest. I am not even Palestinian nor am I Arab but I want fairness for everyone and in the world of major powers, the only power I see asking for thesame is Russia ❤
False holy war fought by the LGBTQ and adulterers only to grab land by genocide. An unholy massacre by the people of demon.
Usa and Israel are a joke and invaded most countries on earth and killed millions. Rather just resign from the UN you a disgrace.
Are they all just schizophrenic they can kill any Palestinians with no consequences ?
So US is saying occupation is legal and court should not consider it illegal.
The Israelis literally “raped and robbed” the Palestinians of their rights and properties and now the Israelis are asking for security guarantees? The corrupt US government really had lost its’ last straw of reputation on the world stage and should face the consequenses for aiding and abetting the genocide. Period!
&#39;Murica genocided the native Americans,<br>Germans genocided africans and then genocided the european jews (they have experience in it now)<br><br>those two cuntries are now facilitating their baby israels own genocide and gaslighting the world trying to  make us think thats ok.
Shame on USA 🇺🇸 <br>Free Palestine 🇵🇸 <br>Free world 🌎  from Western hegemony !
But that US argumentation would give Russias &quot;safety measures&quot; in Ukraine a free pass. Is there noone in this forsaken country ever finishing a thought?
The international society have absolutely no responsibility for the security of Israel. Israel has attacked its neighbors and acted genocidal against Arabs for 7 decades. So if the neighbors are a bit upset, that is Israel’s own problem
Russia is the biggest hypocrite....why doesn&#39;t she  leave Ukraine alone?
Israel is not occupying any territory ....when wll you understand that there was no Palestine....that is Canaan land and you know, Canaan is promised land to Israel!
Maybe Russia should stop Occupying Ukraine
Russia, Iran and allies, the axis of truth and peace ✌️
So what the Americans are saying, the rule needs to be bended to negotiations and not negotiations bended to laws and legal fact that they should get off all illegal settlements..<br>In other words, someone stole your car, he doesn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t give it back to you; though it&#39;s legally what he should be doing; without first you accept to negotiate his right to use your car every weekend for the rest of his life! <br>American legal logic 😏👏👏👏
Diplomatic wont solve anything when facing the barbar US and Israel...
US are the double faced party. They protect vulnerables in Ukraine but watch the vulnerables killed in Palestine. They are the only ones resisting ceasefire.
What about Palestinian security??? The USA is funding the genocide of Palestinians.  They should not have a voice in a court of justice.
USA is the worlds warmonger. <br>They love to divide and conquer.<br>They have destroyed Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan etc.
US shows that it is evil here
I mean, that the US shamelessly requests that the right of &quot;Israel&quot; to function as an occupying colonizer be recognized?......🤯🤯🤦‍♂how crazy!!!
US shows that it wants the intl law to be violated...they arw complicit in the occupation
Its clear that israel owns the usa. American tax payers are their slaves
Occupation cann&#39;t be justified with security of occupier.  What US is doingb at ICJ hearing  is completely Nonsense.  Leave the palastinians and live in peace.  Only solituion to this long lasted conflict.  ICJ must listen to the voice of the world.
Is Russia not a war criminal for invading Ukraine? Some people need to leave earth ASAP. I used to respect but now I need to take charge and be respected instead.

Funny how all the English speakers here have short memory when Palestinian was celebrating 9/11 American killed … Hamas terror act was even more brutal including raps of dead women’s … go watch the footage of you brave enough to see what Palestinian are like as people before you judge her

For everyone watching Al Jazeera. They only show one side of the story if you&#39;re looking for real news look elsewhere
They’re saying the quiet part out loud now, they’ve always just wanted Gaza, because they believe that it’s their land. They will do anything to obtain it.
The world is coming just wait

Our media in Australia is fully supporting Israel as having the moral high ground and a front page report in The Australian described the planes we are sending there to help Israel complete their project in Gaza.
Mordercy

This is the same as an american saying &quot;we are destroying Afghanistan&quot; after 9/11.
They got away with war crimes for years that they now openly do it .
They are showing the world their war crimes.
They are evil
Even satan is shaking his head.

Don&#39;t know why you got likes, while the whole world has witnessed such atrocities off Palestine.  Zionism is dead!
She said we are finishing Gaza, when she means the terrorists, not everyone, so stop talking nonsense
{ يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ }
This is sick 😫 it makes my stomach turn and heart break to hear such hate spread. Those are children, women, fathers all innocent no one is fighting back this is not a war its genocide and theft of Palestinian land! Free Palestinians from the occupation of Israelis illegal invasion of Palestine. Free Palestine!
She should be jailed
Shameless
This is how an occupier behaves with impunity when there’s no one to hold them accountable.
Shame on you singing while you drown palestine with their own blood of innocent children trying to get food and water. Shame on you and it doesn&#39;t matter how much support you get israel, allah the almighty is with palestine
Their singing sucks
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
And then people ask why did hitler do what he did
There achtully doing what hitler did to Jews but there recrating it to the Palestinians
Israel is notttt a COUNTRY!

Israel is overflowing with gentiles
Is this what the LORD JESUS CHRIST WANTS ? No. I AM TELLING THE WORLD. My people are the Real Hebrews Israelites. We don’t treat people like this. The Commandments still stand, YOU shall not DO premeditated murder that’s a commandment. Stop SATAN
This is absolutely heartbreaking
ISRAEL MUST RECLAIM THEIR LAND !!  It was given to you by God.  Stand your ground. You are so brave. God bless you.

Ukraine, Masons and Rothschilds all have the same colors. They rule the world and sacrifice those when and where they want to.
You should all do your research what Ukraine did for Russia to do what they did  before pointing 👉  finger at Putin.  ENGLAND AND USA is at blame for that war as well. Do your own research people  to understand.  Don&#39;t believe Fake News
Ironic, because ukraine shelled Donbass for over 10 years, they supported USA in their invasion of Iraq with soldiers, and they also support Israel.
And She say,thanks USA 😃😃🤘🤘

I don’t understand
Thats nice did it stop any wars? Or is the war continuing regardless?
It&#39;s not complicated that is a lie, and it&#39;s a simple issue. One people stole something from another people and should return it how complicated is that
You know, for a video which its title states how complicated is the situation I don&#39;t see really speak about Israel&#39;s side, but what can you expect from the Guardian after all
Sorry to break it to you but many of the conficts which are very relevant right now are complicated, despite the picture that alt right and wokes try to display
This is the lie they tell you &quot;it is complicated&quot;.
it&#39;s the least complicated conflict in history
One israel defeated Jordan in 1967 they captured back the territory the lost in 1948.
Its Apartheid
So from what I&#39;ve seen the iusses themselves are not complicated, the emotions, and which side is &#39;right&#39; is. The answer I&#39;ve come is this. Both sides have been terrorist, and both sides have done horrible, unspeakable things to civilians. But one clearly has more power, and is objectively worse becuase of that. I can&#39;t find the people of war to support, so I support the citizens who are being hurt on both sides. Neither groups of people deserve hate simply because of where they come from. Call terrorists what they are- terrorists. Those are the people we as a world should take issue with BOTH sides.
Its NOT complicated
It is not complicated but your masters donot allow you to say the truth
There is nothing complicated. Palestine has been invaded.
It&#39;s not complicated at all. Even according to international law, Israel is illegally occupying land that was designated for Palestine, and even kick Palestinians out of their homes using Jim Crow-style laws and violence when they resist.
Very Well explained! Thank You!
It’s not complicated.
At last an objective and informative video, thank you
It’s not complicated at all actually, it’s fully settler colonialism and genocide of Palestinian people
It’s really not complicated, land was stolen, and the colonizers are playing the victims
IS IT REALLY COMPLICATED? This is about something that the USA AGAIN stuck its noses into back after WWII. Many people over history have been pushed out of their countries and no one has done anything to rectify all those people&#39;s situation. But the US and others forced the creation of a Hebrew State on the backs of those already living there through no fault of there own.  In present time, these two groups have been at each others throats so much they cannot be forced to stop, without a third party stepping and intervening. The hate is SOO DEEP most cannot even communicate their hate!
Its not &quot;complicated&quot; its a colonising force genociding its people
The Bantustans complicates it. Dr. Norman Finkelstein explains that it is not complicated. That Israel uses that as a dodge.
It’s not complicated at all, u guys make it complicated cuz u want to !<br>Its as simple as it was 1947 ❗️
&quot;ANTI-SEMITISM IS A MADEUP CONSTRUCT TO JUSTIFY THEIR HORRBLE APARTHIED, COLONISATION AND ETHNIC CLEANSING OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND THE US AND GB ARE SUPPORTING ISRAEL COMMITING INHUMANE WAR CRIMES&quot;
Your video is almost completely useless. No one wants to know the fact that there is conflict in the Middle East between the Palestinians and Israel. What everyone wants to know is why.
One side is a democracy where politicians are accountable. The other side cannot get it&#39;s act together
When its the killing of european kids its an atrocity its evil but when its palestinian kids &quot;its complicated.&quot;
It&#39;s not complicated at all, it&#39;s fairly simple. But it&#39;s a very dense subject. A lot happened. A LOT of small events, many large events.
It’s not complicated, Isra3l has always wanted apartheid- shame on you Israhelll
It is absolutely NOT complicated. Religion based colonialism and genocide on one side, indigenous people fighting for their land on the other.
Not complicated, its the Occupier and its supporters and the Occupied and their sympathisers. The occupier has a colonial project to have an Ethno racist state and the occupied wants emancipation/equal rights and freedoms. This took less than 4mins to read.
This is not complicated, there is one side with all the power, who is backed by the EU and the United States, and the other side has been consistently terrorized for nearly a century, and holds nearly none of the power. Genocide is not “complicated”, it’s pretty easy to see what’s going on in Palestine, and it is horrifying. Free Palestine! 🇵🇸 ❤
It really isn’t. Really isn’t.
It’s Israel’s home land the Palestinians can get lost.
Is not complicated, is simple, Palestine is reacting like any country without army will react against the invaders, very simple in 1948 Israel didn’t exist now they own Palestine? They occupied Palestine.<br>Israel must leave Palestine, they have the right to exist but not in somebody’s else land.
It really isn&#39;t. People just don&#39;t want to face the reality of how isnotrael is mistreating Palestineians
It’s not really complicated. That’s just an excuse.
No, it is not complicated but west wanted to appear complicated because the west doesn&#39;t have the will to solve it. Why? it serves as US base i middle east and imperialist arm inside the Arab world. The solution is: End occupation, apply international law and UN resolutions, just like that you achieve peace since the whole problem are caused because of the unconditional impunity by US and its puppets in Europe.
My Mom would&#39;ve taken the land and only give it back until they learn to behave properly.
The conflict is only complicated if you are a settler living in someone’s house
This is unhuman act by israel to the palestine....😡😡😡
It&#39;s all about money!<br>It&#39;s all about wealth!<br>It&#39;s all about the gas reserves in Gaza.<br>Everyone wants Gaza more than ever!
Why can’t they coexist
Everyone is upset at Israel but it is Hamas that is holding hostages. They have said the cease fire will happen and resources return when the hostages are released. Get angry with Hamas for not doing so and prolonging this suffering.
The undeniable truth is that the neighbour coutries are perhaps the biggest culprit. Without the first arab israeli war and 6 days war the reality in the region would have been completely different, probably more peaceful and with close to equal land size for both sides.
It has never been complicated!!! One side has never respected the law!
This war is not complicated, it&#39;s never complicated. We had  wolfs in sheep&#39;s skin but NOW we have sheep in wolfs skin.
Are they simply stealing the land? How is it that a neighboring military controls the land but don&#39;t provide resources such as water clean water?
ITS NOT COMPLICATED. ITS SETTLER COLONIALISM AIDED AND ABETTED BY THE WEST. SIMPLE.
This is new isreal not the original
I would say a bit slanted against Israel. She is correct that settlements have continued (though at a faster pace under Likud) but she is not correct in suggesting that Israeli governments over the last 30 years have been against a two state solution. The US got Israel (under Barak) to make that deal at Camp David but Arafat rejected it.  Also no mention that Israel turned over governing Gaza to the Palestinians in 2005, that Hamas (Gaza&#39;s governing authority) explicitly dedicates itself to Israel&#39;s destruction nor mentions Oct 7. Israel does not have clean hands nor is morally pure by any means. But a great newspaper needs to be a bit more objective and not selective in reporting history
This reminded me childhood story &quot;THE CAMEL &amp; THE NOBEL MAN&quot;. Once upon a time a man was travelling through the desert along with his camel. It was winter season and nights became very cold in desert. After sunset man decided to take rest and set his camp. Outside camel felt too much cold and requested the man if he can enter his face inside which was accepted. After sometime camel again requested to enter his front legs which was also accepted. But it was not enough for the camel and he entered his rear legs as well. There was not enough space in the camp &amp; the man had to sleep outside in the cold. Israel is&quot;Camel&quot; in this story and the &quot;Nobel Man&quot; is Palestine.
Finally a clear explanation.
It’s not complicated.. You just choose to ignore the brutal occupation..
Complicated? on the contrary its very easy. who is the Occupier, invader, oppressor here? who has stolen homes and land, who has committed Apartheid, who has committed Genocide, who has committed Ethnic Cleansing, who has committed War crimes against humanity   WHO? we all know the answer don&#39;t we?
All this for different religions, which we have no evidence for, if they have any real &quot;sense&quot; at all. Humanity deserves to vanish from the planet earth, if we are not able (and willing) to live together.
Why are people dying over this? Why are CHILDREN dying over this? I’ve heard the complications here, but I ask again as a concerned, evolving, citizen of the world, why are people dying over this?
it’s not complicated honestly
Well, boy , did  this lady call this one
It s not complicated, thats what they want to believe us.
So, what have we learned from invasion, colonialism and occupation?<br>From Ireland to Palestine and hundreds of other places.<br><br>Nothing.
The only settlement of the Palestinian issue would be free elections by all residents of the occupied territories.
No it’s not.
Free palastine
The more i learn about it<br>I feel bad for Israel
Keep your soldiers away from our civilians
Is not complicated. A group of people have stolen lands and the country of another group. They must give it back. Simple.
what a mess. <br><br>These are precious human lives being lost. <br><br>Stop this two state nonsense I say. Put up a government for the people by the people that is &quot;secular.&quot; This hurts to see.
It doesn’t seem the least bit complicated to me
Why don’t they just move to Egypt? I don’t get it
Whats so complicated about Israel being an apartheid state? Whats complicated is to carefully analyse and articulate this point without being called anti-semitic. Free Palestine
Mis information and lies 97% undrinkable israeli provides 95% drinkable water electricity and medical supplies to gaza even tho palastine shoot israel for no reason
So to reiterate, Israel has been occupying and building and taking land from Palestine for hundreds of years already, and Palestine has been and continues to fight back to regain the land
Justice shall be served 🙏🏼
Its not complicated, <br>There is occupation <br>There is resistance <br>End…… <br>Resistance always wins 🎉in old and new history
This felt worth trying to go through :)
THIS IS JUST LUDACRIS.THE GREATEST FORCE THE CREATOR HAS TO INTREVENE.ANY WAR  IS SENSELESS.THERE ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE BEING. SLAUGHTERED. WOMEN &amp; CHILDREN. HOW DEVASTATING.
Long live 💪🇯🇴 Palestine 🇯🇴 Freedom for Palestine 🇯🇴🤍
Thanks 🙏 for the video. I agree it’s complicated.
I would never side with terrorists
Where can I watch the whole video of Bethan McKernan???! She&#39;s very insightful here, I want more!!
It is not complicated. It is simply illegal capture of Palestinian land by Israel. And torture and massacre of Palestinian citizens for 70 years. Don&#39;t say it is complicated. It is very clear.
Absolute rubbish, one sided story
thanks for explianing.
This reminds me of the Irish being under British control for many years. It’s time to recognise the people of Gaza. x
The more I learn about this conflict and the history, the more I feel compassion towards the Palestine people
The thing is that The Palestinians gave israel place to live in their country when no one was
It&#39;s not complicated at all. There is a victim whose land is being usurped and occupied forcefully since 1948 and there is a cruel occupier who kills children women and civilians constantly while stealing their resources and their land . Palestinians are now living every 4 people in 1m2 because of the israeli attacks on gaza ( the criminals have thrown 6000 bombs on gaza in only one week )<br><br>But sadly we live in a hypocritical society where people symphasize with &quot;european&quot; ukranians against Russia but deny pelestine&#39;s right to resist a colonization that stands since 70 years .<br>Neutrality is also wrong . Every human must stand with PALESTINE 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
But it&#39;s not complicated at all 😂
Amazing how you left out british occupation and how the territory was divided 👏🏼 again colonialism at its best
It is not complicated, you just deny palestinians their right to exist as humans !
It&#39;s not so complicated at all. It is settlers overpowering indigenous people, just like in America and Australia.
no it&#39;s really not that complicated
Doesn&#39;t look complicated at all to me, Israel executed a generation of fathers in front of their sons and now they are obviously out for revenge and they think this strategy is not visible to the world, they are sorely mistaken. You might have the power like Britishers and you think they won but the universe has cruel ways to make things even.
Representation of Iron and mud.
Israel has stolen land from the Palestinians
Not complicated
It&#39;s not &quot;complicated&quot; if you are student of ancient history and archeology.<br>There are no Kings of &quot;Palestine&quot;.<br>There are no edda&#39;s or poetry from any &quot;Palestine&quot; culture.<br>There are no  &quot;Palestine&quot; ruins or temples.<br>There are no &quot;Palestine&quot; pottery or coinage.<br>There are no &quot;Palestine&quot; artifact or clay tablets.<br>There are no &quot;Palestine&quot; ancient languages or script.<br>There is no historical or archeological evidence that there ever was &quot;Palestine&quot; country, nation or peoples.<br>It is the name of a REGION. Like the &quot;Sahara&quot; or the &quot;Great Steppes&quot; or the &quot;Amazon&quot;.
**Your question and your according is very bad because  you don&#39;t understand real situation there. It&#39;s before Hamaz entering in Israel they attacked the protesters women by international policy  at the ending tome of their festival. <br><br>If the Gaza&#39;s Palestinian to where go .<br>If they are expelled, where will they go? If you asked to leave your own country, would you go?**`
I have a feeling religion plays a huge role in all this unnecessary conflict
So how did hamas get all these military equipment and weapons ???  If Gaza is so small compare to other areas like isreal?
This is a helpful video on YouTube . Thank you
It&#39;s like you think they just randomly picked Palestine, there&#39;s some thick people nowadays
Newsflash. How Palestine reclaimed its stolen land from zionist while the ICC drift charges against Netanyahu and others
Pity that 99% of your claims in your video have been debunked by historical fact. But 10 out of 10 for pushing the usual BS as fact. Also you clearly are pushing an agenda by leaving out facts that precede events. And you saying trust me in the beginning is dubious and hypocritical at best.
Palestine did not exist as a distinct political entity prior to the First World War. In fact what was defined by the Allied Powers as Palestine actually consisted of bits of three different Ottoman Vilayets/Sanjaks. It wasn&#39;t even one single defined region.<br>After four centuries of Ottoman (Turkish) imperial rule over the entire Middle East, what became Palestine was governed for five years under allied military occupation and then the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine came into effect, putting Great Britain in the role of Mandatory Power, as per a legal document called the Mandate for Palestine. You are welcome to read the Mandate. It is readily available on the internet. In it Palestine is recognized as the national home of the Jewish People and the Mandatory Power is obligated by international law to facilitate Jewish immigration and settlement in Palestine to ensure the establishment of the Jewish national home. There is a caveat that was added saying that territories east of the Jordan river could be omitted from the Jewish home, but specifying territory east of the Jordan clearly implied that all territory west of the Jordan could not be omitted from the Jewish home.<br>The mandate came into effect in 1923, so anyone suggesting that the conflict began in the 1940&#39;s is either misleading or ignorant. In fact the Arabs were fighting tooth and nail against the mandate for years before it even came into effect.<br>Very little of Palestine was privately owned. A great deal of the territory is reminiscent of a moonscape, nearly uninhabitable. Much of the land settled by the Jews was swamp land that was worthless until the Jews drained the swamps and made them usable for cultivation. All this had been taking place since the Zionist movement was founded in 1897 and even before that. Neither during the British nor Ottoman rule were Jews &quot;given&quot; land belonging to Arabs. Certainly Jews could not &quot;take&quot; (or as Palestinians love to allege &quot;steal&quot;) land. The idea that the governing Turks or Brits would allow that to stand is ludicrous. The Jews were sold land, both privately as well as public land, and Jews worldwide donated funds to finance the purchase of lands in Palestine. After violent rioting and massacres carried out by Arabs in protest, the British authorities actually mapped out areas where it was illegal for Jews to be sold property.<br>What did occur in 1947, specifically on November 29, 1947, was the UN vote to ratify resolution 181, which detailed the UNSCOP plan to partition Palestine, thereby providing individual &quot;independent&quot; States to Palestine Arabs and Palestine Jews. In addition the Jerusalem district was to be governed for up to ten years by a UN trusteeship. The two States were to have an &quot;economic union&quot;, though what that meant was unclear. What was clear was that not a single Arab or Jew would have to be displaced. No property was to be lost. Arabs residing in the Jewish State were to be given the option of Arab State citizenship if they desired. The two States were to have an initial population of 800,000 each, with 100,000 Jews and 100,000 Arabs remaining in the Jerusalem UN trusteeship. The Arab State was to be almost exclusively Arab. The Jewish State would have 300,000 Arabs and 500,000 Jews, though hundreds of thousands of Jews awaited the opportunity of resettling in the Jewish State after being displaced during the Holocaust.<br>I suppose you could say that the League of Nations, officially and by international law recognized the Jews as the rightful &quot;indigenous&quot; people of Palestine in 1923, and decreed that Palestine be transformed into the Jewish national home over the course of the Mandatory period. In that respect all of Palestine was given to the Jews in 1923. The UN then recommended that the Jews renounce their title to half of Palestine at the end of 1947, giving the remainder to what the Mandate calls the &quot;existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine&quot;, ie. the &quot;Palestinians&quot;. The Jews actually acceded to the UN&#39;s suggestion to that effect, however the Arabs insisted that they, exclusively, were entitled to Palestine in its entirety, in part because they had succeeded in preventing the mass immigration of Jews envisioned by the League of Nations. Six million Jews were slaughtered and yet the Jewish population of Palestine remained six hundred thousand short of a majority. Who knows how many Jews would have survived Nazi extermination had the British not appeased the Arabs and barred Jews from escaping to Palestine. And yet millions of people are convinced that the Jews have no rights in Palestine because the Arabs in 1948 had succeeded in maintaining their majority.<br>On May 14, 1948 the Mandate ended and the British left. On May 15, 1948 the armies of Syria, Egypt, Transjordan, Iraq, and Lebanon crossed their recognized international borders into what had been, until the day before, Mandatory Palestine, with the express intention of destroying the nascent Jewish State, and seizing all of what had been Palestine for the Arabs. Nothing was given. However, by transforming Palestine into a battleground, the Arab armies caused a massive refugee crisis. The Palestine Arab population had no intention of living in a Jewish State; they were persuaded that if they remained the Jews would massacre them and commit atrocities upon them; and those who attempted to confront Israeli forces in armed combat were forced to flee. They were assured that the Arab armies would defeat the Jews and they would be able to return to their homes shortly. As a result of the combination of these causes, vast numbers of Palestine Arabs fled, abandoning their properties, and choosing to live as refugees rather than being loyal citizens of the State of Israel.<br>In the aftermath of the 1948–9 &quot;War of Independence&quot; the properties abandoned by the refugees living within countries that remained at a constant state of war against Israel, unable to return and unwilling to live at peace with the Jews, were gradually confiscated by the government of Israel and redistributed, as Jews who had awaited the opportunity to rebuild their lives in the Jewish homeland after the horrors of the Holocaust, were finally able to come home.<br>The Arab claim is that the Jews are colonists and have no legitimate connection to Palestine. To believe this one needs to be either intentionally ignorant or a tremendous conspiracy theorist. The history of the region and of the Jewish People is beyond question, and yet that is exactly what those trying to de-legitimize and vilify Israel do. Yet it is academic. What matters is that the League of Nations was clear in its recognition of the rights of the Jewish People and the historical connection between the Jews and the Land of Israel. The Jewish national home has been reconstituted, and day by day Israel becomes more prosperous and secure, while the Arabs of Palestinian descent become more and more mired in their hatred and intransigence.<br>The Arab claim to being entitled to the exclusive hegemony throughout what was Palestine &quot;from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea&quot; is not a valid claim. It has never been. The Arabs have been given hegemony throughout the entire Middle East, which they conquered in the seventh century only to be defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. One of every five Israeli citizens is Arab and enjoys democratic equality under the law, despite claims to the contrary. The Palestinians of the West Bank and even the Gaza Strip could benefit from a mutually beneficial partnership with Israel based upon the principles of cooperation, compromise, and coexistence. Those are principle they have to accept upon themselves. They cannot be forced upon them.<br>Tragically, it is their obstinate refusal of normalization that prevents Palestinians from achieving prosperity. By incessantly lambasting Israel while making no demands or even criticism of the Palestinians, the obvious bias of the international community encourages the Palestinians to remain intransigent, and to avoid engaging with Israel to resolve this perpetual conflict. Your own suggestion that the Palestinians have a valid claim, without even having considered whether the Jews&#39; claim is equally valid, is symptomatic of the reason the Palestinians remain in their current situation. The Jewish People have an inalienable right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland, even if the United Nations seems only to have attributed that right to the Palestine Arabs. Until that truth becomes apparent to the Palestinians and the world at large, there is no hope of a resolution to the conflict.
How did the Jews end up in England?
I love when people condemn Britain for colonialism and then condemn decolonisation as Britain handing over their problem to someone else. Also I found this video very informative and fascinating. Particularly with regards to the selection of facts
So that means we shoulfnalso stop the immigration and land taking of muslims in Europe I guess? There are millions of settlers in Europe 😉
He keeps saying &quot;they lost their country&quot;, but there was no country. Yes, individual families might have lost their individual plots of land, but they were living on land occupied by the Ottoman Turks.
People act like they know the history after reading one article. Do more research, and try again
Sounds like what happened in the usa
How would Israel defend its truly  hideous occupation of the West Bank?
This video is spewing nonsense and leaving out all information that’s inconvenient to your argument.
Have you even heard of the kingdom of Israel with king David, Solomon, and Abraham? It was there. 6000 years ago.
maybe theland &quot;could&quot; have been Isreal&#39;s, doesn&#39;t give them the right to randomly kill kids in the streets of Gaza. like at all if they were religous people they first approach shouldn&#39;t have been killing innecent people and aressting litte kids. people everyday get shot and murdered and kicked out their homes.
there are a few spots with misinformation that I would like to correct:<br><br>at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE8GCX1w3ys&amp;t=140">2:20</a>, how was the land 90% palestinians if palestinians didn&#39;t exist until the state of israel was established? how many of those, which you claim to be palestinians, were arabs that migrated into the land of israel in an attempt to prevent the establishment of a jewish state? and how many were cherkes, druez, christians and bedouins?<br><br>on a sidenote, since you have been mentioning palestinians fighting for independence, despite the vast majority of them being immigrants just like the majority of jews, palestinians did end up getting independance in 2005, after israel has traded the gaza strip away for a chance of peace, and has been rulling themselve since then, untill they started another war on oct 7th. not mentioning the countless terror attacks they have both planned and executed against israeli citizens in the past 75 years.<br><br>at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE8GCX1w3ys&amp;t=240">4:00</a>, the jews indeed were allocated 55% of the land, leaving arabs with only 45% of it, but most of the 55% land that was allocated to the jews was inenhabitable dueto lard amounts of swamps, malaria and tons of mosquitos<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE8GCX1w3ys&amp;t=265">4:25</a>, the jews did accept the 48&#39; border allocation, but the palestinians started a war when the brittish mandate ended and lost it, hence technically losing all territory.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE8GCX1w3ys&amp;t=275">4:35</a> this is untrue as well. jews didn&#39;t target arab settelments nor the had it as their goal to remove arabs from the land. since the land was under a state of war, many arabs have fled, with arabs leaders backing them up, saying that after winning the war they will able to get double the amount they were owning before, which they ended up losing<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE8GCX1w3ys&amp;t=290">4:50</a> palestinians didn&#39;t lose their country as there was never a palestinian state nor any palestinian government before the establishment of israel, they declined all partition plans, started a war and lost it, hence losing any possible land they might have already got otherwise<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE8GCX1w3ys&amp;t=350">5:50</a>, palestinians were not ethnically cleansed, nor the arabs that did stay in israel. as I mentioned before with most arabs leaving off free will, the population of palestinians in both the west bank and in gaza has grown a lot in numbers since, which isn&#39;t appropriate for an ethnical cleansing. same with israeli arabs which now are 20% of israel&#39;s population<br><br>anything in the next minute is completely false as well but has too many points for me to be able to list every single one of them seperatly<br><br><br>another sidenote, the name &#39;palestine&#39; was given to the land by the romans in an attempt to shadow the connection of jews with the land. during the brittish mandate the brits has adopted that name and has called anyone residing in it as palestinian, jews and arabs alike, as well as all the other minorities. before the establishment of israel, it was almost exclusively jews reffering to themselves as palestinians, and after the establishment of israel it was arabs refering to themselves with this name instead and have kept this name to this day while anyone who stayed in the state of israel started reffering to themselves as israeli instead - jews, arabs, muslim, christians, bedoing, drouze, and anyone else I have forgotten to mention, alike, sharing the same rights.
Palestine was ruled by the British; 95% of the population was Arabs of different religions. Britain then gave it to Zionists and they took it over. The truth is simple, don’t complicate it.
Resr in peace everyone
Plastilin is The Century&#39;s Anti-Semitism Invention as a Continuity to the 1938 agenda.
It&#39;s interesting that a whole side of the story you chose to say is simply &quot;not complicated&quot; because you deleted the facts.  Suddenly <b>out of nowhere</b> the United States accepted that there is a country??  Suddenly <b>out of nowhere</b> the British just gave a state package like a chocolate package??  Yes friend, apparently when you tell history like a three-year-old child it&#39;s really not complicated.
well says all u says its true and happen.A great video!
Israel’s wars with its Arab neighbors: Are we a joke to you?
This is so funny 😂
You so called Palestinian just want to steal jewish land! And eliminate Israel state. It will never be happen. So get over and move on build yourself a Palestine country! Stop jealous in jew!
It always was Jewish land! 3000 years! So called Palestinians are from Egypt and Jordan and Arabs countries!  Second Arabs leader demands Arabs to leave their home after 1948.  Thoes who stay become Israeli Arab!  And by the way it wasn’t million Palestinians layer!
Exactly what happened to the Serbians in Kosovo in Serbia but nobody bats an eyelid. Where the Albanians ethnically cleansed the orthodox Serbians once they became a majority over time. Serbians made a mistake to allow them over the border to work when they were a minority and didn’t know they were planning on becoming a majority and then with the help of the West for their own agenda to get a foot in Europe were able to steal the land😮 horrible human race is only for land and greed. Serbians built Kosovo the centuries with hundreds of ancient monasteries and infrastructure only to be stolen by the invaders.
They just took the promise land back, if they were as bad a people say they are, there would be no Palestine
makes you wonder what hitler was up too ey?
Viva Palestine ❤❤
You can actually smell the misinformation literally bubbling out of this guys mouth...
The Enigma of the Arabs and Israelis. <br><br>In all human societies , whatever their identities are, are all land based, grounded and have their identities defined from within their land territories. Now in human terms it means a lot. One of the means to secure the space in which this community exist is off course is to control it by force or war. This means shedding blood of its own members. Now shedding blood for land territory in ethnic societies around the third world means purchasing land with blood of their members. The other is off course is to leave behind markers, evidence, historical monuments, written or oral history, etc. The third is off course their culture, traditions, language or the living cultures. Fourth they have to occupy this territory or space for very long periods measured in generations after generations of its members. <br><br>Now regarding the question of the Arabs residing in Israel and its territories, from records of history, it has been occupied by a lot of ethnic groups from both the neighboring Arabs in the first century and before that by Greeks, the Romans, and even much earlier than that the bibilical nations. Israel also came into the fore when it conquered the resident bibilical nations like the philistines, the Jebusites, Amorites, etc. Israel rightfully claimed the territorial space by war, built a civilization there for over 3 millennia until the Roman empire dispersed them throughout the Roman empire. Still there were Israelis living there in Israel up to the modern era. The Palestine name came much much later during the time of arafat and the PLO movement. Now the Israelis feel that they need to return to their homelands after the fall of the Roman empire and the rise of modern nations of Europe and in other parts of Africa, Americas, Asia and the Pacific. <br><br>If you look at this historical context, really the people of israeli as a nation, have a valid claim over their historical lands where their ancestors have lived and left an indelible mark and a name identity they created for very long periods in human history. Now their children will stand for this name, their identity and their land. You cant blame them for this. If the arabs and muslims around the world can read and accept world history, perhaps they can find peace and understanding of who are the jewish and israeli people are. If we cover up the facts and fuel our egos with hate and ignorance, then we have a serious issue with our we create a world in the 21st century...we might as well evolve into the dark ages.
Check your book who stole Israeli.
nah bro but the actual fact that in the quran it is written that the land belongs to the jewish
The Jews have lived in that region since the time of Joshua in the Bible since around 1400 b.c. Many times the Jews were driven out of their land but there has always been some Jews living in the land. First the Assyrians took it over, then the Babylonians. Cyrus of Persia allowed them to rebuild the temple which the Romans destroyed when they dispersed the Jews from the land and Hadrian renamed the land Palestine. I am amazed at how ignorant people are about history. You obviously need to do more research so you can get ALL of the facts.
Can this be more historically wrong? Wow
Torah never mentioned Palestine<br>Bible never mentioned Palestine<br>Quran never mentioned Palestine <br><br>From when Palestine exist?
You can tell if someone actually believes what they are saying by what information they present.
I wonder if all this would still be happening if israel kept the sinai peninsula from egypt.
No, it’s not complicated. Everyone agreed on a two state solution except for the Arabs so that’s why we went to war Hamas decided they didn’t like it a 2  state solution. I think you’re incredibly biased. And you’re not telling the full truth about history.
I hope you cover the historical fact that there never was a country by this name. That the so-called Palestinian people are a moderate invention. And that archeology proves historical fact of it being Israel&#39;s land back to 4,000 years ago. Your fake country has never had a prime minister never had its own official language no official government.  It&#39;s amazing how people can be so ignorant and not research historical facts and buy this BS.  Jordan is Palestine.
Given not stolen....if you go to war and lose, the land goes to the winners
amen
THE BOOK OF PROPHET EZEKIEL  CHAPTER  33 <br><br>1<br>The word of the LORD came to me:<br>2<br>Son of man, speak to your people and tell them: When I bring the sword against a land, if the people of that land select one of their number as a sentinel* for them,a<br>3<br>and the sentinel sees the sword coming against the land, he should blow the trumpet to warn the people.b<br>4<br>If they hear the trumpet but do not take the warning and a sword attacks and kills them, their blood will be on their own heads.c<br>5<br>They heard the trumpet blast but ignored the warning; their blood is on them. If they had heeded the warning, they could have escaped with their lives.<br>6<br>If, however, the sentinel sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the sword attacks and takes someone’s life, his life will be taken for his own sin, but I will hold the sentinel responsible for his blood.<br><br>7<br>d You, son of man—I have appointed you as a sentinel for the house of Israel; when you hear a word from my mouth, you must warn them for me.<br>8<br>When I say to the wicked, “You wicked, you must die,” and you do not speak up to warn the wicked about their ways, they shall die in their sins, but I will hold you responsible for their blood.<br>9<br>If, however, you warn the wicked to turn from their ways, but they do not, then they shall die in their sins, but you shall save your life.<br><br>10<br>As for you, son of man, speak to the house of Israel: You people say, “Our crimes and our sins weigh us down; we are rotting away because of them. How can we survive?”e<br>11<br>f Answer them: As I live—oracle of the Lord GOD—I swear I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! Why should you die, house of Israel?<br><br>12<br>As for you, son of man, say to your people: The justice of the just will not save them on the day they sin; the wickedness of the wicked will not bring about their downfall on the day they turn from their wickedness. No, the just cannot save their lives on the day they sin.g<br>13<br>Even though I say to the just that they shall surely live, if they, relying on their justice, do wrong, none of their just deeds shall be remembered; because of the wrong they have done, they shall die.h<br>14<br>And though I say to the wicked that they shall die, if they turn away from sin and do what is just and right—<br>15<br>returning pledges, restoring stolen goods, walking by statutes that bring life, doing nothing wrong—they shall surely live; they shall not die.i<br>16<br>None of the sins they committed shall be remembered against them. If they do what is right and just, they shall surely live.<br><br>17<br>Your people say, “The way of the LORD is not fair!” But it is their way that is not fair.<br>18<br>When the just turn away from justice and do wrong, they shall die for it.j<br>19<br>When the wicked turn away from wickedness and do what is right and just, because of this they shall live.<br>20<br>But still you say, “The way of the LORD is not fair!” I will judge each of you according to your ways, house of Israel.<br><br>21<br>On the fifth day of the tenth month,* in the twelfth year of our exile, the survivor came to me from Jerusalem and said, “The city is taken!”k<br>22<br>The hand of the LORD had come upon me the evening before the survivor arrived and opened my mouth when he reached me in the morning. My mouth was opened, and I was mute no longer.l<br><br>Those Left in Judah.*<br>23<br>The word of the LORD came to me:<br>24<br>Son of man, these who live among the ruins in the land of Israel are saying: “Abraham was only one person, yet he was given possession of the land. Since we are many, the land must be given to us as our possession.”m<br>25<br>Therefore say to them: Thus says the Lord GOD: You eat on the mountains, you raise your eyes to your idols, you shed blood—yet you would keep possession of the land?n<br>26<br>You rely on your swords, you commit abominations, each defiles his neighbor’s wife—yet you would keep possession of the land?<br>27<br>Say this to them: Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, those among the ruins shall fall by the sword; those in the open field I have made food for the wild beasts; and those in rocky hideouts and caves shall die by the plague.<br>28<br>I will make the land a desolate waste, so that its proud strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will cross them.<br>29<br>Thus they shall know that I am the LORD, when I make the land a desolate waste because of all the abominations they committed.<br><br>30<br>As for you, son of man, your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doorways of houses. They say to one another, “Let’s go hear the latest word that comes from the LORD.”<br>31<br>My people come to you, gathering as a crowd and sitting in front of you to hear your words, but they will not act on them. Love songs are on their lips, but in their hearts they pursue dishonest gain.o<br>32<br>For them you are only a singer* of love songs, with a pleasant voice and a clever touch. They listen to your words, but they do not obey them.<br>33<br>But when it comes—and it is surely coming!—they shall know that there was a prophet among them.
You forgot to mention way before 1916... 34 AD a Jew name Jesus Christ lived in that land and was killed by the Romans.
This is not true.  Palestine was actually owned and occupied by one of the 12 Tribes of Israel in the Bible from thousands of years ago.  Say what you will.  The Bible holds the TRUTH.  It has always been part of Israel.
Whoops, there goes the neighborhood.
it starts with Arabs pilligeing the Roman empire not ww1
Israel didn&#39;t steal anything. It was their land.
This video is ABSOLUTELY absurd please don’t listen to a word this guy says
NOW Let’s tell the story from the Israel’s perspective. Let’s talk about how the land that was overwhelmingly Jewish and Christians became nearly entirely Muslim. Your answer is probably gonna be, well that was a long time ago. <br><br>IGNORANCE
Funny how you ignore the fact that JEWS were forcibly removed or fled when the Ottoman Turks and Muslims nations conquered the area known as Palestine. <br>         They didn’t just choose this land by flipping a coin.
How about start from the BEGINNING. This issue started long before WW1. The Jews settled that land long before Islam was a thing. Let’s start at the very start
Absolutely wrote his own history of this situation please people do your research and make your own decisions
Don&#39;t forget the &#39;Balfour Declaration&#39; - Lord Rothschild was involved - says it all
Which muslim country was not taken by the sword and rape, what goes around comes around
How can the Palestinians ask for a state when they are the invaders and occupiers of foreign land.
Only 2 flags have no state, LGBT and ISRAEL.
So Israel was there before Palestine, Palestine took control Israel had already been taken over more than a few times. If you start it at 1916 then yeah…. Palestine was occupying the land at the time. If you go back to B.C then Palestines land originally was not the country they are in now. If you look it up you can follow where the Jews went from b.c until present day, you can go back and follow historical documents that show the wars the migration. It’s there, now everyone has to push an agenda/opinion instead and leave out all the history before 1916
Jews were there 1200 years before islam even existed
Your information path is full of holes and omissions . Unfortunately you have been betrayed by your decisions and your leaders. Jews in Israel predate your people, proven by history and the bible. Nice try, feeble though.
Here’s a question kbappe why were Jews in Europe to begin? If ancient texts and Roman history report some to be in the Middle East, why did they have to move to Europe? Rise of Islam perhaps
IT SI NOT COMPLICATED.  EUROPEANS AND U.S.A. WANT TO HAVE A COLONY IN THE RESOURCE RICH MIDDLE EAST UNDER MULSIM/ARAB CONTROL.   ALSO, U.S.A.  WANTS PEREPETUAL WAR. EVEN AFTER THE ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN CONFLICET IS OVER, WARS WILL CONTINUE BECAUSE THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMLEX IN U.S.A ON PERPETUAL WALL.    ISRAEL AND AMERICAN  DEPEND ON ARMS SALES.  THE WAR DEPARTMENT IN U.S.A. HAS UNLIMITED UNQUESTIONED SUPPORT ON THEIR BUDGET.    ONLY THE ECONOMIC DOWNFALL OF THE U.S.A. AND ISRAEL WILL FREE PALESTINIANS.   SOME NATURAL CATASTROPHY OR WWIII  OR DIVINE INTERVENTION SIMILAR TO  THE DAYS OF LOT, THAMUD, FIRAOON, NOAH  ETC ETC. ...<br>MAY ALAH SEND HIS JUSTICE TO PALESTINE AGAINST THE OPPRESSORS. AMEEN.
He only talks about the history starting from ww1 the history starts more then 10,000 years before ww1
Here is the problem we are the original Hebrews that we can prove it even though Jewish people are  Yiddish .We are the original people  of GOD. We welcome you  in our country when no one would accept you  with open arms and then you stole Land from us and rape our children and women. this isn&#39;t sovereign, may Hashem show you a different path of life by being accountable 4 your actions🎯💯💖‼️
Populistic video, you omitted the following facts:<br><br>1. The Arabs countries calling Arabs to leave their homes in Israel in 1948 with a promise they would return after the won the war (which they lost). And also you omitted the actual Arab invasion.<br><br>2. The fact that similar partitions in the area created other Arab countries which are basically ethnically same to so called Palestinians<br><br>3. The facts that Israel actually BOUGHT most of the land from Arabs so they could own it<br><br>4. That the territory that wasn&#39;t part of the partition plan was conquered when it was fought over with Arab armies<br><br>5. That the west bank and Gaza were not occupied until 1967, and after that Jordan and Egypt (the countries that Israel conquered the land from) DON&#39;T WANT THE PALESTINIANS OR TERRITORY BACK
no! it starts with The Creator God who made the promise the covenant  with Abraham and his seed ...Jews and only Jews...no one will ever take it ...
I don&#39;t agree with the genocide on EITHER SIDE of this conflict, but unfortunately there&#39;s nothing that can be done. There can&#39;t be peace without understanding, and some choose not to understand peace.<br><br>The Jews lost their home, they were exiled, they were still mistreated in Europe, then they fled back to the land they originally lost.<br><br>Both sides aren&#39;t innocent. You can win by destroying an enemy, sure, but don&#39;t be surprised when another comes for vengeance.
So basically. . . don&#39;t let a bunch of people immigrate into your country if they don&#39;&#39;t speak your language, share your values, and don&#39;t look like you. . . otherwise you end up with endless conflict?  Got it. . . but it sounds pretty xenophobic to me.  QUEERS FOR PALESTINE!  Also. . . Chickens for KFC.
And also, at the time of the 2nd World War, the USA rejected the Idea, to take ALL Jewish People, to their own Country. Therefore, the US Goverment, supported, from the beginning, the Creation of the artificial Construction, of the so called &quot;Israel&quot; on Palestinian Land.
Very good Explanation 👍👍🇪🇭,👍🇪🇭👍🇪🇭👍🇪🇭👍
The land belongs to Abraham, Issac, and Jacob! The land has always belonged to Israel, and God already told u by way of prophecy that Israel would return to THEIR land! So the promise comes thru Issac not Ishmael!! <br><br>When America divides Israel, God already told you, through the prophet Joel chap 3 that he will utterly consumed the nations that would DARE  divide his land, because the land belongs to Israel, so any deal contrary to that fact is void! <br><br>All of society is about to come under the justice of God!! Time to run to Jesus!<br><br>Repent or perish<br>Love in Christ 🤍
Clearly the narrative is FAKE, There is no such thing as ethnic Palestinians just ARABS living in Mandatory Palestine at that time and the British gave them land, its called Jordan. Its like saying that if the Pilgrims migrated to the US in the 1300&#39;s they would be considered native americans.
This video is a good example of an incredible manipulation with historical facts. And it is really sad so many young people in the western world believe it only because they think the one who is poor is the &quot;good guy&quot; while the rich one is the &quot;bad guy&quot;. What does HAMAS fear the most? PEACE! If there is PEACE, there is no HAMAS and no billions of dollars sent to Qatar.
Palestine never existed as a sovereignty. How can it be stolen?
The land belongs to the jaws you are not telling the truth
U know israel aint bad its just not secure <br>Free Palestine 🇵🇸
I am the son of a survivor of Dachau yet I strong condemn the barbaric treatment of the Palestinians! Look, The NEVIIM ( Hosea <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE8GCX1w3ys&amp;t=557">9:17</a> says &quot;My God rejects them because they have not  obeyed Him and they shall go wondering amoung the nations&quot; Why? Because the TORAH ( Lev <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE8GCX1w3ys&amp;t=1523">25:23</a>) states &quot; The Land is Mine ( says the LORD) you are stangers resident with me&quot;. Thus the land of Palestine was LEASED to the Nation of Israel on conditions. One of those conditions was &quot;Blood of the INNOCENT will not be shed&quot; TORAH ( Deut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE8GCX1w3ys&amp;t=1150">19:10</a>). Thus God &quot;scattered them amoung the nations&quot; TORAH (Deut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE8GCX1w3ys&amp;t=267">4:27</a>). The Allies after world war two had no right to reverse God&#39;s judgement! Look at the trouble in the region it has caused culminating in this new &#39;holocaust&#39;. God will end it all soon! Judgement!
&quot;the native invaders&quot; that&#39;s what I hear when you talk about the nativity of the Palestinian Arabs, named after Philistine(Invader)
This video intentionally hides key facts:<br>Jews are indigenous people of the land that is now called &quot;Palestine&quot;.  They had lived there way before any Arab or Muslim stepped foot on this land. They are not &quot;Western colonizers&quot;.<br>There was no Palestinians back in 1919. There were Arabs and Jews living on that land. Arabs didn&#39;t call themselves Palestinians until Arafat promoted this name for political reasons in sixties last century.<br>So long story short, no, Jews di not steal the land they returned to their ancestral land after 2000 years in exile.<br>Read Noa Tishby book A Simple Guide to the Most Misunderstood Country on Earth, you will understand all the issue
That&#39;s not true the pattern actually is Muslims (Islamic empires such as Ottoman empire) or Palestinians stole the land from ancient Romans who stole it from ancient Jews then in 1948 the Jews said we just want a portion of our land to have an actual state in it you arabs or Palestinians can have the rest but the Palestinians said no we want the rest of it we don&#39;t care if it was yours back in the ancient times we steal it we get it. The Jews then said ok we&#39;re gonna steal back some of it then and they did and the Palestinians cried Nakba even if they still have some piece of the said land.🤷😂
No one stole anything from anybody.  Another terrible propagandist spewing his BS.  1948 UN resolution actually gave the Palestinian Arabs ~ 2/3rds of the area now called Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank.  Additionally, there was also tremendous violence against the Jews also living in these areas by Arabs.  You never hear about this from the Palestinian propagandists.  Jews and Arabs BOTH were evicted from some of the areas they inhabited.  Again, you won’t hear about this from the Palestinian Arabs.
I stand with Palestine 🇵🇸
They bought their land ..from absentee Turkish  landlords and rich Arabs who moved to England , America and the Arab countries.<br>Everywhere you look...the Arab League  countries sold you out.
This video is right away nonsense, falsity, and misinformation. Nah thanks
Your title very wrong... you know the history..
Israel didn’t steal anything. It was their ancestral home.
Why is no one holding the UN responsible? The british turned the problem over to the UN who handled it. They just up and gave them land- they havent given any other displaced people land- what about native americans? What about Tibet? No? UN just gives isreal land displacing palestinians at the time and worse clearly until now - letting them take more and  and no one is pointing arms at them? They caused it!
Its not that complicated sounds like how America was created, taking something that belonged to someone else and using the Bible as a souce
Lies
Interesting commentary.  I&#39;d like to know where you get your facts.  Seems to me that the area which is now Israel was largely unoccupied, as it was mostly a wasteland, devoid of life.  Seems to me the Jewish people spent decades refurbishing and replenishing the land to make it capable of sustaining life.  Seems to me the mass pilgrimage back to the homeland was out of loyalty, to work and help to rebuild that which was lost.  <br>Seems to me the first mention of Palestine is actually Palestinia, which the Romans renamed the area of Judea(now Israel) after a massacre.  This is also a reference to the Philistines, who were non-Arabs that dwelt in the area now called Gaza.  Those people are gone to history.<br>It seems to me the next mention of Palestine is in 1917, when the British ceded the land formerly part of the Turkish Empire, to the Jews and the Zionist state.  At that time the area was named Palestine, but the population was very sparse, because most of the area was wastleland.<br>The next mention of Palestine is by Yassar Arafat, who fostered war with the Jews by funding the terrorists to attack Jewish settlements.  With much publicity, he created the palestinian people, which before did not exist.<br>Seems to me that every effort at peace has been refused by these &#39;palestinians&#39; as they are funded by the Iranian government to create chaos in the region.  These poor people have been brainwashed for decades, and no longer have much claim to humanity.  Witness what happened when they emigrated to Jordan, and to Lebanon.  Civil war, and terrorism.<br>I might be missing something, but it seems to me that the area of Israel was largely inhospitable, and therefore unoccupied, until the Jewish people came and rejuvenated it.  There is much documentation about this.  Explorers from the turn of the century remarked how desolate the area was.  Then in the 1930&#39;s journalists were writing how the Jews had transformed the area into a paradise against all odds.<br>I am sure there are missing pieces to this puzzle, but I am not at all sure there really is a palestinian people, as they are not in any historical narrative.  <br>Yet, in 2005, Israel ceded Gaza to these people.  It was a paradise, of gardens and ports, and beauty.<br>They could have built a state, and won the envy of the world, instead, they destroyed it.  Utterly.<br>Now they wish to destroy more.  And if the succeed, and eliminate the Jews, then what?  Egypt? Jordan? Lebanon? Since they are terrorists, and destroyers, where will it end?
So if Jews were 10% of the population should 10% of the land be given to the Jews?
I’m a New Zealander and I find it hard to understand the different claims each group has for the contested lands. It’s confusing and living on the other side of the world makes it all that more removed from reality unfortunately. <br><br>     What land ,you claim, has been stolen from the Palestinians exactly? The land with all those thousands of years of Jewish history, where all the countless millions of Jews have lived generation after generation. Is that the land that has been stolen from the Palestinians? The land with all those Jewish geographic and cultural place names, is that the land you mean?
What a joke of a video
TRUMP: Muslim ban now.<br>WORLD: YOU RACIST!!!<br>MUSLIMS: decapitating children and raping women is resistance to occupation!.<br>WORLD: umm....Trump?<br>TRUMP: yeah?<br>WORLD: Muslim ban?<br>TRUMP: told ya so.
&quot;out of nowhere&quot;  🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ im out also, bye 😂
As it was ever Palestinian land in history
why they gave palestine to jews ? its easy devide and conquer also play hero ater they wound you
All countries were conquered.
🐂💩
Palestinians are a fictional group. In 1948, there were no plans whatsoever for a Palestinian state, nor any mention of a Palestinian people. Those terms were conjured up around the 1960s, to play victim. In 1948, the plan was simple - destroy Israel, kill all the Jews. Finish Hitler&#39;s work, basically. The Arabs started a war and failed. They have never accepted this loss and still hate Israel.<br><br>Look at the treatment of Jews across the Middle East. This receives barely any attention. About 800,000 Jews fled, not because of war, but because of gov&#39;t systematically taking away their rights, along with numerous pogroms. About 460 million Arabs and within their countries, they barely have space for about 20,000 Jews today. In contrast, 2 million Arabs live in Israel.<br><br>This is one of the most black-and-white issues in politics and one of the issues with the most vehement and widespread propaganda (including this video). At this point, to support Palestine is to unabashedly support terrorism.
Palestine is like a box of chocolates.  Oh the eloquence🙄<br>Helps that the narrator points at us repeatedly.  Ironic that this fellow looks and sounds to be a product of some kind of mixed background.    This video is weird, bad-addled stuff.  I hope the narrator has had time to go home, sit a bit and re-think his next attempt at lecturing anyone BEFORE he opens his mouth.
Ahh that remember me to the Palestinian &quot;KiD&quot; (sry but for me a Kid is under 13) that has to go to jail for nothing. When he goes inside he was 16 and later he can go with 18 because of a Prisoner change. Thats so sad.... ahh wait... he wasnt innocent? .....What he stabbed 3 Jews to Death?... yeah.. but its just because of the Jews evil Israel.... ah what? How dare u calling me the &quot;A-Word&quot;
West Bank don&#39;t have Hamas
Yea it&#39;s just the rocks lol
how much isreal pay you🤣🤣🤣
Of course human guards have many disadvantages as people need to eat sleep and poo
You make a machine using Human being to test it. This is special type of evil.
They isntalled that before oktober
Yesss
What he&#39;ll isreal want?
And they said all about oct 7..
Fun fact: your country (you) payed for it for billions
I just love listen women defending guys from a religion that treat them worst than dogs. 😂
Most countries have street cameras 😂😂😂
Na z I of today... who would have said?
Kids with rocks!! Sound biased.
Because you can&#39;t trust terrorists
Remember oct7.
The great thing about anything that that is computer controlled is it is hackable, foolable, etc.  May take some time but people will find a way to F _ _ K with it.
😢😢
Dejen de ROBAR TIERRAS Y MATAR CIVILES Y VAYANSE CON SUS PATROCINADORES
Not because of kids with rocks
Ofcourse, US sold it to them to use and advertise on the dehumanised population
I think this creates a pretty unrealistic political perspective. The defenses are not there for kids with rocks, they are there for very valid reasons from an Israeli pov. With regards to kids getting shot at, just remember it is not uncommon for radical Islamic groups such as Hamas to weaponize children, so soldiers will not dismiss a situation just because a child is involved. Is this a bad situation for innocent Palestinians? absolutely. My heart goes out to all of the innocent people suffering as a result of this conflict on both sides. For those of you that are appalled by what you see, well that is war for you, any war, doesn&#39;t matter who the participants are.
Just imagine if that kid throw an orange wrapped in papers and, the IDF army got scared.
The fact that one video shows a kid playing with the bomb with no fear💀💀💀💀🗿🪨🪨
By Golly! Could it be to protect from terrorists and those kids? Hmm..
Free Palestine! 🇵🇸❤️
How did you become such a propaganda machine
They are occupation… don’t be surprised
Free free Palestine 🇯🇴
All that &quot;rabbi&quot; did was go on a racist tirade telling lies about Palestinians in order to dehumanize them. Disgusting.
Nah, definitely not apartheid.<br><br>It&#39;s sooooo beyond apartheid! 😢
Free palestine 🇵🇸♥️
Isreal is a terrorist state shame
israel will always be scared.
Some people believe that Israel is defending itself, but they forget that the entire land belongs to the Palestinians and Israel is merely a Western occupying force. Some believe that Israel is technologically superior while the Palestinians do not have minds, while they forget that Israel, after a 20-year siege of Gaza and preventing any type of materials used in wars and with endless supplies of the latest Western technology and trained people, has not yet been able to overcome the resistance in Gaza, and is now embarking on a process of starving civilians and killing as many children and women as it can, to put pressure on the resistance, due to the failure of the Israeli-American mind to overcome the Palestinian mind. It is like a huge wrestler entering the wrestling ring with all internationally forbidden weapons in front of a weak-bodied opponent without a weapon, and when it becomes clear that this cowardly wrestler is losing, his team puts pressure and intimidates the weak wrestler’s family into surrendering.
They shouldn&#39;t be surprised about homemade grenades considering how long they&#39;ve oppressed the palestinians
Stop this monster called I s r a e l NOW 🍉
Now is the moment for global unity against radical Zionism. Currently Palestinians are the victims of radical Zionists. But the next victim might be you.
Its a fuking camera<br>How do people get those ideas remember in 2020 someone said israel is making gasoline <br>Out of children? Just shut up
This is how they&#39;re gonna say that &quot;the bullet find its own way to hit a 3yr old young lady&quot;
I am an American Jewish i went to Israel and i see a palestinian kid bleeding and i went to the Israeli army or medic to help but when i ask to help the palestinian kid they said No they are arabs just trow them away and i was shocked to see their reaction
Disgusting use of power
Man’s u are stupid on another level
Astughfarallah<br><br>They are kids... KIDS, why, they have no soul <br><br>Free palestine 🇵🇸
Westoids on the comments showings their humanity once again
Human Rights group organizations are behind all dictatorship and criminal around the world.
Meanwhile hamas telling its followers that they get money house if enough Israeli kids are murdered <br>I mean Isreal at least gave time to evacuate whereas hamas killed innocents and unarmed in a rave party
Israel is a highly militarized country that develops and exports new weapons. They regularly test new surveillance and military technology in Palestine and make big profits by exporting these technologies to other countries. Many Palestinian casualties result from such testing, but of course Israel always make excuses and say that they&#39;re fighting so-called terrorists.
This is called border patrol and control. Just don’t trespass.
Lie after lie. Pathetic.
And the world just watched like it’s ok in this day and age for this kind of treatment to people who actually own that country in the first place and Israel just taking it like they have the right to do so, it’s just so astonishing that the Arab countries just let it happen casually without making the world see what was going on
So much madness
Battlefield Israel, sad to see they have become what they most hated. 😞
Keep playing victim
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Human experimental subjects to test their new weapons to sell to the other oppressors around the world
Israel one of the best technological countries,would put a an &quot;AI gun&quot; to target kids with rocks 😂,bruh if theres an army,armored jeeps then why would they need to install a gun to shoot at kids 😂? Don&#39;t be fooled guys 😮 this girl don&#39;t knpw nothing but to blame israle
Israel is baby killer
Y’all clearly have no military experience
Shame on occupied forces
Israeli side just trying to protect their people
Now imagine Russia doing this in Ukraine… absolute joke
Free Palestine ❤
This is the moral army and democacy in middle east
israel is soooooooooooooo scared
Tired of trying to explain the truth 😢
for the algorithm
israeli sniper shot dead a 13 yrs old kid doing nothing, and testing dangerous things no matter smoke,grenade, or turret yet they still say &quot; its ONLY smoke launcher&quot;<br>what if someone put an automatic smoke launcher to your place that it causes so much pollution its hard to breath? It could be a turret too or worse.<br>and no israeli supporters are talking bout that. <br>just shows israel are hallucinating palestinian supporter
American technology money
Don&#39;t forget this is Palestinian land recognized by UN...
West bank ? Where there is no Hamas 🤔 just another proof that it has nothing to do with Hamas, but with Israel being a terrorist country
Mondoweiss hire real journalists what is this
Cowards
The mainstream media told me that hamas takes civilians hostage, put mortar launchers on school roofs, and uses child solders. But now I find out all they do is throw rocks. Unbelievable
Psychos 😢
It ain&#39;t kids with rocks that did Oct. 7.<br>By the way  how is the Palestinians doing now....<br>The probably fired on kids cuz the were on a threatening manner...<br>Quot playing or die should help you not act a fool .
Did you ever heard about Hamaz
It’s nice of her to say all that without some actual footage of a Palestinian being experimented on with weapons .-.
As a Military myself, I can say, that Kid or Not, if you fk around Enough, you ARE going to Find Out!
Sending kids to the war zone,men have no guts to go?
Excuse me jehade u dropped your victim card 😂😂😂😂😂
JESUS WILL RETURM SOON. BE PREPARED

Free Palestine
So many bot or zombies for zionist. They are easily fooled by &quot;40 decapitated babies&quot; fake israeli news but dont ask them about thousands of real palestinian babies decapitated, burn and buried by jewish supremacist state. Its all hamas propaganda they say.
Attacks from both sides are disgusting. The deaths from either side need to stop.
That is not terrorism, Israel has right to defend itself. Pathetically low if it is  civilized thought . Should all the countries adopt this technology to oppress civilians! Will it promote progress or fear . Israel is Terrorist state .
And there&#39;s absolutely no reason at all they&#39;re putting up all that security, is there?
Poor 😢 innocent 😢 helpless Israelis defending themselves biggest lies of the century America and other western countries helping them with everything and every means possible in this genocide which is for land&#39;s..
david a jew killed goliath with a rock. so guess they know the power of a rock as mankind&#39;s 1st long range weapon. so stop throwing rocks and they might not find a reason to shoot them because of it... move along.
If you want to throw rocks at people with guns, that is probably the dumbest thing a human being can do, but hey. You do you 👌
Stupidity you try riding a bus in Israel before the wall and praying an explosion doesn’t go off from a suicidal bomber. You weren’t around pre wall
Today&#39;s Palestinians have more Jewish genes than European Jews who claim the land as their own, and are the original inhabitants of that land, the same people who were forced to leave their homes and then had to watch them bulldozed, the same people who were expelled, their families murdered, their children kidnapped, and summarily imprisoned, the same people. Who have to live under occupation and apartheid rules Most rabbis agree
The Jews are the sons and daughters of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They have the right to live in this land!
🇺🇦🇺🇦♥️🇮🇱🇮🇱 stay strong Israel
Palestine is the Land Canaan. The historic Land of Palestinians. Palestine will be at the end liberated from the zionist Occuopation. There is no doubt.
You can not displace a population the way the did displace Palestinians. The so named &quot;jewish&quot; problem was a European problem. Now it is Zionism. Pray you never have them as your enemy
some very wrong &quot;facts&quot; are stated in this documentary - Israel controlling all Gaza borders and Gaza as an &quot;open air prison&quot; is about as wrong as you can be... also &quot;palestinians&quot; like that &quot;teacher&quot;/ murderer were not &quot;forcefully&quot; removed from their homes they CHOSE to leave as they were under the impression they would have ALL of israel in a few months.  Haifa until today is inhabited by Jews and Arabs alike (the Arabs that CHOSE to stay in Israel) the Arabs that did not make it their sole mission to kill and destroy anything that is Israel... The Arabs that are in the Israeli parliment today and as high as the Israeli Supreme court... I hate these &quot;compassionate&quot; documentaries that give Murderers and terrorists Justification for what they do...
Free free Palestina
النبي المجنون محمد اغتصب طفلة عمرها تسع سنوات.
The problem is an innocent generation born into conflict and bitterness you belong to a party you don&#39;t choose at birth
60 Ans d&#39;occupation serait plus juste !
More like 3,000 years of conflict of Israel with the Philistines (Palestinians).
Today 24/02/24 Zionists have killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians most children and babies. They have decimated North Gaza and forced 1.5M Palestinians to the south and said it will be safe and they have started attacking that and now the Palestinians have nowhere else to and are Rafah and that is being bombed now. Free Palestine 🇵🇸 Gaza is like Autchwitz / warsaw ghetto..
75 ans d&#39;Apartheid  , d&#39;occupation et de tueries  !!!<br>Et non pas de contlit comme vous-avez le culot de répéter en pure perte  !!!
Many of the new immigrants to Israel lived in tent cities called ma&#39;abara camps<br>which turned into prefab hut cities.
Why didnt Palestinians declare a State of Palestine in 1948 with Jerusalem as their capital city?. In their 1964 National Charter article 24 states:<br> &quot;This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area.&quot;
The day you start talking about Jihad, Islam&#39;s religious war, you will understand the conflict. Until you do that, you are reciting something from others who want you to think that way.
Israel and the world is just another confirmation of the word of God
zionist propaganda this one,  best to skip...
You don&#39;t even got to watch this documentary it tells you everything you need to know in the first 2 minutes about whose land it is who took what from who and who pushed who out
They killed Yitzhak rabin because they dont want peace with the arabs.
whatever...
This Docu. is FAKE there is no Palestine land! They are grabbers from different places of Arab. Read the History!
In reality it is the Palestinians who occupies the Land of Canaan (Israel).
اسرائیل شصت سال اشغال سرزمین فلسطینیان و شصت سال قتل زندان و شکنجه آن ملت با پشتیبانی غرب و آمریکا!.
Initially the Land of Canaan has been given to Prophet Abraham. The so-called &quot;Palestinians&quot; never existed in the Land of Canaan. From the Land of Ur, the Jews have always been in the Land of Canaan.
Look at Saladin and Baldwin the fourth story.
Stop the Palestinians struggle! Live in peace and joined Israel rule!
FREE PALESTINE !!
🇮🇱 🇮🇱 🇮🇱  💪💪💪
It was the Arabs that started first war against Israel in 1967 in 1972
You were all asked to leave until the Arabs had slaughtered all the Jews. This never happened as Israel won all the wars. The so called lie regarding the Nakba?
🔯🕎🇮🇱
A ma connaissance les Palestiniens n&#39;ont jamais fabriqué quelques ce soit. Seul Terrosime et Mort.<br>Et quelques olives.
Hi  The english and Amercia should have left there those are the 2 countrys are the whole blame for the war today..😎😎😎.
LONG LIVE ISRAEL
A precious documentary that helps us understand, even if difficult to accept, how we arrived at the horror and atrocities of these last months. An impartial look, as history reports should always be. Thanks for sharing and reposting it. Dated yet always contemporary.
No meu cristianismo essa porcaria só aconteceu por esse povo de Israel ser desobediente e sofre essa crise até os dias de hoje. Uma carnificina de anbos os lados. Dois povos valentes designados a lutar até a volta de Cristo renegado por eles.
הערבים רוצחים יהודים יותר ממאה שנים עוד לפני פרעות תרפט בלי שום קשר לנכבא או בבא
This documentary is biased and not telling the complete truth.  The Israelies only attacked Egypt as a preemptive strike because they were going to be attacked first, and had to foil the enemies plan. Israel had every right to protect themselves.  Other facts have been excluded but Egypt has managed to keep their peace treaty with Israel to date.  Also, the Israelis have always owned the land.  God said He gave the &quot;title deed&quot; of the land to the seed of Abraham, isaac, and Jacob.  Not to mention, their land would extend from the border of Egypt up to the Euphrates River, over 300,000 square miles (PLEASE READ....Genesis 15:18)

The land of palestine is not israel
Ce n&#39;est pas un conflit. C&#39;est une histoire de colonisation barbare et terroriste par une population venue d&#39;Europe (israéliens) et une populations locale (les palestiniens) qui sont depuis malmenés, déportés, assassinés, torturés, affamés et enfermés dans des camps de concentration<br>Cet Israël symbolise les NAZIs de ce siècle à la différence que ces nazis là sont applaudis, protégés, financés et armés par l&#39;occident qui pourtant avaient combattu les nazis allemands !<br>Ces NAZI israéliens colonisent même les pays d&#39;occident après avoir acheté par leur financement, tous les politiques occidentaux !
State of Palestine not Israel
Они пришли из европы сионисты и окупировали Палестину
Why did the Arabs run away in 1948? Surely if you believe its your land you stay and fight for it
it is important to note that Palestine is the name of a geographical region, and not the name of a nation or people, the real name of this land is the land of Hnaan, on this land in ancient times there were two Jewish kingdoms, Israel and Judea, there was no Palestine when the Romans conquered this  land, in order to punish the Jews, they called this land Palestine.  so everyone who lives on this land, including Jews, can call themselves Palestinians, because this is not a nation, these are the names of the land, but those who call themselves Palestinians by nationality are in fact Arabs who migrated to this land from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan  , all this has been proven historically, and not only, in all the holy books, the Torah, the Koran, the Bible, it is written that the land of Khnaan belongs to the Jews by God’s call, there is not even a mention of the great Palestinians.
Every time Palis start intifada they get NAKBA. they never learn anything at all. They all became persona non gratas all around the world. The day they accept Israels independence and start peaceful co - existence their liberation will come, but no sign of it!
Lots of new things I had never known on the conflict…great documentary, thanks you!
1928-Haj Amin al-Husseini (&quot;Plastilin&quot; movement creator)encouraged a Jews massacre.<br>1941 - HA- Husseini met with Hitler to encourage the &quot;final solution&quot; in Israel and Europe.<br>1974 - Plastilin kidnapped 115 Israelis, mostly school children, and killed 31 of them.<br>1993 - Israel pursued peace with “Plastilin” invention on the Oslo Accord.<br>1994 -  “Plastilin” unleashed suicide bombers on buses, leading to horrifying scenes.<br>2005 - Israel evacuated Jews from Gaza; Gaza  “Plastilin” turned it into a state of terror.<br>07/10/2023 - THIS TIME Plastili FILMED THEMSELVES DOING WHAT THEY DO SO THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CAN SEE.
So basically, Muslim&#39;s outnumbered Jews,but Jews outsmarted muslim...<br><br>Even with number&#39;s muslim can&#39;t win.
its not a conflict its an Israeli occupation
Isreal and Benjamin  the Hitler and leapole of the century
I think it&#39;s safe to say this is the most complex conflict there exists. It&#39;s not black and white like many people try to portrait. We cannot say that there is a clear &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; side in this conflict. May there be peace one day, although I think we won&#39;t see that in our lifetime.

Imagine 60 years ago, Israel state was established. Now 2024 the Palestinians are enslaved people by Israel. However, if the Arab states combine their resources (men, money &amp; materials) to a war of attrition (pocket wars) in Gaza (Hezbollah, Houthis, Syria, Iran among others), then Israel&#39;s economy shall be downgraded. Only a 2-state solution can resolve this conflict as per UN resolution w/ a UN force (with teeth) to oversee the implementation.
The historical record bears out the claim. Google the Arch of Titus erected in the Roman Forum
So basically Arabs keep starting wars they can’t win
Bias Documentary .
God bless Israel 🇮🇱
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸
Putin hates his own people, like the world&#39;s other dictator. Thanks to  Putin loving Republicans here in the USA, the entire party had Ukrainian blood soaked into their hands.<br>As an American, I am sickened and angry at the group that has become Russian. I apologize to Ukraine.<br>Plus I apologize for being an American who ignored Putin&#39;s invasion of Crimea a decade ago.
U left out the actual cause of Nekba! They could&#39;ve stayed under belfour but instead started war when they along with all surrounding Arab nations decided to gang up and attack Israel....they caused death and displacements while ruining the belfour. Instead of moving forward like the several hundred million ppl they keep up the same insanity.
Let’s all relax and get real here. Polish belong in Poland, Nazis belong in Germany, and Zionists belong in Austria. These three groups are in Palestine acting like they’re middle eastern!
This documentary left out the Egypt border, saying Gazans were stuck due to Israel borders on all sides. Egypt has an equally solid border because despite being Muslim they don’t like Palestinians. They allowed them to live in Egypt for a time but the Palestinians decided to attempt to overthrow the Egyptian government. Not a smart move.
This documentary leaves out that Israel would not be a military superpower without the massive unlimited support of the USA. This is why the USA and Israel are hated in the middle east and rightfully so
60 godina okupacije i terora nad palestincima
Quienes ponen los muertos?
The Bible is many stories passed down and changed over time, no real evidence in any who owned the land, and whoever has the archeology narrate  interpret and perceive document how they want! Ridiculous to claim something from a story that supposedly 3000 years ago, that the land God chosen people, so the people who have been in that region and ancestry from there, they are getting genocide?.
Не 60 лет а 75 лет, первая резня была ещё в 1948 года так до евреи зашли в деревню людей Убивали и сожгли всю деревню
Some things the documentary leaves out that is somewhat important. It was the Arabs that started the first war and asked the 700,000 Palestinians to leave their homes and return after &quot;they kill all the jews&quot;. Another fact, all the neighboring Arab countries expelled all their Jews to Israel during the same period yet nobody ever talks about them. It&#39;s important to point out who started the war, it would dispel a lot of sentiment of entitlement towards Palestinians to the land lost.
docudramas of Al jazeera are far better
the war between Israel and Palestine started since DAVID AGAINST GOLIATH
Funny how when the other arabs ruled gaza and west bank they didn t call themselves palestinians and didn t want a state 😂
Jews are on stolen land, just like I am as a Canadian . I feel ashamed. We were never taught that in school. Canada belongs to indigenous people, not white Europeans.
Je proclame le 9 mars 2024, jour de la naissance de l&#39;etat de palestine sur toutes les terres de palestine du jourdain a la mer. <br>Allons refaire la meme histoire que les sionistes a partir du 9 mars 2024.
God bless israel 🇮🇱
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_isZHaZjcU&amp;t=3519">58:39</a> I would like to see this moment filmed from behind Clinton, Rabin and Arafat: why is Rabin jerking and eying Arafat? He for sure didn&#39;t look relaxed at any moment in this clip anyway...
I wouldn&#39;t want a zionist country as neighbour either, we had the the nazis for 5 years from 40-45, same ilk. Now they show their true face to the world.
This ppl never wanted peace after steal the land and will never live in peace there , God still dislike them

If al the jews all ofer the world go to Israël to fight fore Israël.but if a moslims do that all ofer the world they are the teroris and get kill  and in prison al over the western country al so in Amerika that is. Apartheid to the moslims &#39;they don&#39;t want that the moslims are one if they one the arabic country the war gone stop  they dont have power anymore on the arabic country and that is it china have the power they are one Rusland have the power they don&#39;t do that to Rusland the Israël and the Amerika Israël aël go do propaganda news that arabic moslims palestina no good they are teroris because the Israël most be in fear of arabic people so they can go to fight the Israël.they all are brohers and sisters the Israël jews and the arabic moslims christian but they fight about the religion and fore ho is the country the country is for all of them jews Israël moslims palestina arabic christian jews no christian jews ect ect all people ho have a different religion and don&#39;t believe they are brothers and sister they fight each other that way is war repeat evrery years. Lik the story from Isaac and abraham and jesus  how Israël can be holle land if they fight and killing each other Hitler loste the war and Israël start the war in Egypte palestina.
Why is everyone okay with Ukraine having a cultural hatred for russians, but theyll call these people terrorists? (Not to even mention Myanmar... lol wheres that?)<br><br>Hint: Check the skin pigmentation of the participants! Just a little trick Ive picked up over the years...
And that religious book one of you mention belongs to billions of believers Jews and Christian’s. So far every prophecy is fullfilled. Seven more to come and we are at the cusp of it. The B agreement gave the Jews back their original land including Jude’s Bethlehem and all what the people of Gaza wanting to steel. Even if they succeed for a short time, due to the partial world pressure on Israel, the price one pays when some people want to steel from God  is cursed.
T.Q you story about Israel.
Crazy people
The Jews have records going back to 3500 years, archeological facts more than enough to satisfy the claim if you ever had any education in history/ ancient history. The Arabs living in Gaza actually land of Israel belong to Jordanian tribes and had been driven out of Jordan by Hussein the current king Abdullah’s father( Black. September) for this tribe had been infiltrated by jihadic terrorists Arafat an Egyptian born terrorist who called it the PLO. Got a long time now no other Arab countries welcome this people as they created trouble everywhere the lived. So by the curtesy of the stupidest Oslo agreement the Israelites got stuck with this killers having Hamas as their mentors
60 лет оккупации!
The problem is one side of the conflict is not willing to live in peace with the other side…<br>One side wants the other side dead and no compromise. This has been the case for almost 80 years. I have not seen one story that is from the Israeli side or showing two sides…only show from the perspective of the Arabs. Palestine is not a country but Israel is a country!
There is no israel .....its so stupid...😂😂😂😂😂
Господь защити Израиль еврейский народ
You don&#39;t use the right terms, and facts. Arabs could have a state, but rejected it! They refused to. Accept Israere l! Many of the Arabs were immigrants from arab countries and not originally palestine. On the Nacba they were told by arab countries to live their homes until they will kill Israelis. But, the jewish didn&#39;t die.  800000 jewish were sent from their homes in arab countries. You didnt mention it. You didnt mention the attacks arab countries did. That Egypt controlled gaza, the gaza people are not palestinians. They are  Egyptians. Jordan controlled the west bank they were jordanians. Not palestinians. <br>Gaza was slams before, and better with Israrl.
THE LORD GOD HAS ALREADY MADE A COVENANT WITH THE JEWISH PEOPLE 6000&#39; YEARS AGO,GOD CAN&#39;T LIE , IT&#39;S WRITTEN IN 😊😊
In Jordan Palestine caused troubled and driven out, in Lebanon Palestine also bring chaos to Lebanon economy and peace..
Till now Arab countries still telling lies
Free Palestine
Soru
Free PALESTINE 🤲🕋🕯️🙏📿🕊️☮️
Asrail is a terarest group, no country
Am I allowed to cite the Hamas Charter? <br>&quot; There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad.&quot;<br>&quot;Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it&quot;<br>The hate does not come from ME.
Israeli aggression and not a war.
IDF started to break the truce first...
❤ Free Palestine
hamas said there is no possible peace in sight???? They also said they wont stop killing jews until no jew lives in pallestine or israel. <br>Dont start something you cant deal with.

As a result of Balfour&#39;s barbaric declaration, the Palestinian people have been fighting to seize their homeland from Israeli colonial rule since 1948... that is the historical truth.
This is not a war this is Genocide as an American I’m with the Palestine people, this war should stop

Now we have jews condemming other jews because of ethnicity, instead of joining the fight for total freedom of victimization.
Liars
For journalists, the world living in layers is a double standard. Did I see Western countries saving Russia because Putin was weakening their plans?  forced  many councils, and now they support Israel to continue killing innocent people? Where is The court issued arrest warrants for Putin saying that Putin kidnapped children who would now be living a good life, why don&#39;t they arrest Netanyahu after he killed more than five thousand children????

No record of banks bomb by Israel ,those that means there is no bank there?
Why no records of bank bomb?, Is there no bank in Gaza?
even though the Zionist troops gather and AlQuds will not be destroyed, God is always with the patient people (Palestine)
Just like the world terrorist occupying Israeli military forces are killing the Palestinian people, the Palestinian forces should enter the territory of Israel and kill the Israeli citizens, demolish the high-rise buildings of Israel.  The Jews will not be sheltered by the Christians of Europe.<br>বিশ্ব সন্ত্রাসী দখলদার  ইসরায়েল সেনা বাহিনীরা যে ভাবে ফিলিস্তিন  মানুষদের হত্যা করছে, ঠিক তেমনি ফিলিস্তিন বাহিনীর উচিত  ইসরায়েলের ভূখন্ডে ডুকে ইসরায়েলি নাগরিকদের হত্যা করতে হবে, ইসরায়েলের উঁচু উঁচু বিল্ডিং গুড়িয়ে দিতে হবে,, শুধু সময়ের অপেক্ষা মানুষ হত্যা পাপের জন্য একদিন ইহুদিরা দংশ হবে, তখন মুসলিমরাও ইহুদিদের আশ্রয় দিবে না ইউরোপের খৃষ্টানরাও আর তাদের আশ্রয় দিবেনা।
Hamas fighting with american weapon
The news should say Israeli genocide on Gaza not Israel T war
Israeli government is international criminal group.
iDF implores for a month for the Un involved Palestinians to move south. Many did, but many didn’t because Hamas is preventing them from doing so. That is their shield. That is also why rockets that are fired over civilians in Israel for years are placed in side civilian neighborhoods, inside mosques, schools and so on. They know that up until now Israel didn’t fire at those places. What happens in and underneath the hospitals is the same. All Hamas leaders are in underground Gaza and their headquarters are underneath Hospital
Ang esrail ay killer dahil pati mga civilian bata man ay kanilang pinapatay 😢😢😢
You killing Innocent people and you guys making propoganda 😢
May Allah help us
Israelis  Zionist  are terriers

Us- backed terrorist IDF is raining  white fosforus on Gazans.    Why don&#39;t  you report that?
The Islamic religion teachings has many flaws in it, which says there god Allah will give them jannat (salvation) doesn’t matter how many crimes they have done on condition if they follow him. How can we not expect for the people to act evil. It’s a Satan not god who is saying the same thing that Satan says. It’s can not be Gods words.
Islam is not a religion. It’s a pure Satanism and people are fooled and are in dilution that it’s a god. It’s the Satan which take the form of God and make people to obey him not to question his laws which is completely unacceptable
shame on ISRAEL and USA

Netanhahy is big terrorist
At this moment when Israel has sent most of its forces into Gaza, if Israel&#39;s enemy countries attack Israel, Israel will lose its strength!  If we allow Israel to win the Hasa war and be a bystander with the peace of mind that &quot;our country has not been attacked&quot;, then Israel, which until then relied only on its warplanes and powerful weapons, will gain strength in ground attacks with the experience of the Hasa war.  In that inspiration we can see attacking Yemen or Lebanon next!!  Because Israel is now gnawing at Gaza.  Some allied countries that cannot bear it are biting Israel from the sides.  Israel will look back with a bloody mouth at the end of the story of Hazara to those sentient nations that had been biting it until then.  Israel will flow with a country in it.  After that it will be impossible to keep up with Israel.  If Israel... To create a state of fear, all Middle Eastern countries will have no other option but to be slaves to Israel!!!<br> It is well known that Saudi Arabia is a brainless, spineless lazy country that enjoys selling its resources to the US.  While other countries are bolder, the reason for reluctance at this time is not understood.  But in later days you will realize that the situation will not continue.
Israel zindabad
Falsely  figure

Why this war.... They are also human beings why are they brutally attacking the Palestinians........ free Palestine 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Free palestine 🇵🇸
ADios hamas
Question. Why is no one calling out Hamas for hiding behind their citizens (thus putting them in harms way, willingly) and for the initial attack on israeli civilians? Let me be clear, i get that IDF needs to stop blowing up civilians, an eye for an eye makes the world go blind, and calling out and protesting is warranted. But NOBODY is calling out Hamas. What gives? What makes it okay for Hamas to use their civilians as human meat shields. Why only call out Israel? Someone clarify?
kamu negara islam negara arab yang perampas ini berani serang palistine yang pecuri tanah pslistine dia serang lagih punya tanah kalau menang israil di orang ambil sudah tanah palistine jadi kita negara islam tengoh sedja bagus negara islam tiada lah di dunia kita bersatu lah lawan israil jangan penakut.

Look,even the middle east wiped out american soil is still untouchable .america is very wise
Where are those islamists saying hamas doesn&#39;t use schools or childrens playground to launch rockets,,
Hamas instigated all of this.

Hey AJ+, why can&#39;t I comment on your videos?? Why are my comments removed immediately after being posted?
Obviously  what a stupid  question <br> The world hates and condemns israel
If you coward don&#39;t poss in you tube
Who are they blocked palastine people go anywhere.😡
White people are not the only ones who can be racist. Ive seen more racism against whites than i have seen against anybody else.
If Isreal is guilty of this, then Palestinians are definitely guilty of it as well.
Dpr sure they are guilty.. look back at the history..
It’s not apartheid apartheid is keeping things apart Jews want to exterminate Palestinians
We give them water electricity gas food for free
As a South African, I recall that Desmond Tutu, may he rest in peace, one said that in many ways, the apartheid the Palestinians endure is far worse than that of our own. I agree with him. They deserve freedom. 🇿🇦 🇵🇸
There’s a reason israel doesn’t let it’s citizens take DNA tests. <br><br>Israel knows that once all the European Zionists in Israel realize they have no traces of Middle East blood in their DNA, their whole argument of ancestral homeland goes out the window
no
These atrocities have been hidden to the world. Fewer people that knew these atrocities. This must come to an end.

The Truth is that Barbaric migrants are being flushed out of Jewish homes they invaded and are being rightfully returned to Israelis.<br>In Europe Barbaric Migrants are invading and colonizing the white indigenous people and living of welfare the migrants and their fore fathers never paid into.<br>The fake suffering of the poor poor plasticine creatures is the product plasticine Leaders  make money from , the donations pouring in allows them a luxurious standard of living.<br>Why would the plasticine Leaders want to get ride of multi billion dollar product?  why would activists want to get ride of the product that gives them a cause?<br>plasticine is the biggest lie of the 21st centaury.
Ladies and gentlemen, &quot;the only democracy in middle east&quot;.
Israel must remain a Jewish State
As an Israeli, I have to say this video is tendentious. I encourage you to take everything that was said here with a grain of salt (although not completely dismiss it) and keep searching both sides of the argument to form a more informed opinion on the matter.
Israel is committing GENOCIDE. Where&#39;s the UN? Where&#39;s the International Law?
The most crime  ever committed
You just cherrypicked that guy talking about &quot;supremecy or a group&quot; then took another cherry picked moment with that girl talking, and you put them together. Both moments were talking about something else, and both had seperate context.  Post the whole clip. You wont because this is fake news
Palestinians have dealt with this injustice for 75 years. I hope for a world where the Palestinian people get to live a peaceful life.
Its funny how jews arent even allowed to vote, hold office or citizenship in palestine but israel is still being called the apartheid state…. The irony….
Israel is using weapons of mass destructions against Palestine
This is stupid we are all “looking at Palestine perspective but we never went to look at Russia’s or Afghanistan’s or Iraq’s perspective. I’m not saying these countries are right for doing what they did it just shows how nieve and stupid we are
This was 2 years ago and what has been happening in the last 3+ months, Israel and western media wants people to believe Israel has the right to defend itself? what a JOKE?? Treating palestinians as sub-humans and taking their land, home, cutting them off of basic necessities way before 7 October make Israel and Israeli nth short of Nazis. People all around the world are not stupid and blind and FINALLY Israel&#39;s trueface is exposed. Thank god, people are more aware and support the Palestinian cause. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freepalestine">#freepalestine</a>. Love from Bhutan
Yes
Israel guilty
No

This is false
“in other words apartheid”???<br><br>Fact check1 :<br>Gaza has been it’s own entity ruled independently since 2005. Israel has the right to control the border with a foreign entity. That is not apartheid! Lol<br>Is that an EU definition of apartheid, “having national borders”?<br><br>In every country in the world citizens of that country have better rights, access to health care and voting rights. Citizens not of that country need visas and pass check points. How is this different? Israel have arab politicians, no separate beaches or buses, it’s not apartheid. Every actual citizen have equal rights.<br><br>Israelis definitely do not have freedom of movement to go into Palestinian controlled areas without guards unless they want to die.<br><br><br>Fact check 2:<br><br>Listen to an actual arab living in Israel rather than this lady…<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sksCvn6YZrs">https://youtu.be/sksCvn6YZrs?si=lWxCr1GvmvKwBoiY</a>
Yes
Calling the territorial conflict between Israel and the Palestinians minimizes the brutality of Apartheid in South Africa. If you want to understand why the term doesn&#39;t apply to Israel, read &quot;Drawing Fire&quot; by South African anti-Apartheid activist Benjamin Pogrund.<br><br>You intentionally left out that Apartheid is intended to be permanent domination based on race. 1. There is no intention for the occupation to continue permanently and 2. there are millions of Palestinian citizens of Israel who have full civic equality.<br><br>Also, Palestinians in East Jerusalem are entitled to apply for Israeli citizenship. Many choose not to, but there was an uptick in applications following the Oslo accords, presumably because they wanted the option of remaining in Israel following a two-state solution.
The United States was pretty close
no ... this just disaprove everything you just said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/s3etOKxW02M">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/s3etOKxW02M</a>
Gaza has a border on the Egyptian border. And your Israel map doesn’t ’spot’ or colour areas where Arabs live - 21% of Israel’s population is Arab - they’re not clamouring to leave or move to other Arab countries.
They are evil
Zahir Muhsein was a Palestinian leader of the pro-Syria As-Sa&#39;iqa Ba&#39;athist faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization between 1971 and 1979.<br>In an interview with Trouw Magazine, 31. March 1977 he stated.......<br>&quot;The Palestinian people do not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct &quot;Palestinian people&quot; to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons!&quot;<br><br><br><br>Hamas Minister of the Interior and of National Security Fathi Hammad, aired by Al-Hekma TV on March 23, 2012. Stated.....<br>.....we all have Arab roots, and every Palestinian, in Gaza and throughout Palestine, can prove his Arab roots - whether from Saudi Arabia, from Yemen, or anywhere. We have blood ties. <br>Personally, half my family is Egyptian. We are all like that. More than 30 families in the Gaza Strip are called Al-Masri [&quot;Egyptian&quot;]. Brothers, half of the Palestinians are Egyptians and the other half are Saudis.<br>Who are the Palestinians? We have many families called Al-Masri, whose roots are Egyptian. Egyptian! They may be from Alexandria, from Cairo, from Dumietta, from the North, from Aswan, from Upper Egypt. We are Egyptians. We are Arabs.
Haven’t you seen videos where arabs and palestinians walk around israel, taking pictures in the beach , going anywhere they want? This video is BS
That is Incorrectly the &quot;Palestinian&quot; regions are governed by those they elect and separated by security wall and fencing.  Israeli citizens have equal rights no matter what Nationality , Race, religion, color ect. This is all villainy &quot;Palestinian&quot; terrorists supporting lies you tell!
I love Israel
Sorry but most are lies or without any context.
Don&#39;t just watch this and form an opion, you need to deep dive on both sides of this conversation.
&quot;slippery slope toward apartheid&quot;, LoL
Israel &amp;Co. are the modern day Nazis, can’t make this up
Not true Israel is trying to attack and own Palestine 🇵🇸 because the uk told it to so they can get out of there
Regarding claims that Israel is an apartheid state, he said: &quot;Has anyone of you come to see apartheid in this country? It doesn&#39;t exist. Apartheid doesn&#39;t exist, &quot;Same way those Jewish tunnels &quot;don&#39;t exist&quot;...&quot;ANY MORE&quot;  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Israel has wasted decades in conflict with Palestine. The shortsightedness of its leaders has led the country into a highly militarized state, hostile to its Palestinian neighbours, in the false belief that conflicts and wars will bring them prosperity. On the contrary, it has degraded Israel to a state that uses an apartheid-like policy and mass genocide as justifications for its supremacy. Israel is actually a poor yet dangerous country, as there is no greater poverty than the lack of ethics, morals, and humanity!
Gaza is governed by HAMAS, not Israel. Please get the facts right. And the West bank is only partially controlled.
This is really upsetting to watch! Especially when you know Israel denies to westerners their doing genocide or apartheid. 😡
It is. It&#39;s been since the Oslo accords. Get over it and stop accusing Israel and attacking Jews for things they are not guilty of.<br><br>The better question is if &#39;Palestine&#39; is guilty of apartheid because there&#39;s no Jews allowed there.
This angers me so much, how dare Israel get a pass on these atrocities
PRO ISREAL
End the brutal occupation and apartheid of the Palestinians now
Yes guilty <br>Disgustingly blatant
There is no such thing as a Palestinian. The Palestinians are a bunch of Syrians, Jordanians, Lebanese and Egyptians.
I wish Za apartheid came back. Za is in pieces since the blacks took over.
The narration of this video gives me Prager U vibes. Very different agendas
APARTHEID IS PERFORMED BY ISLAM AND MUSLIMS AGAINST WOMEN AND OTHER FAITHS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don&#39;t act like Palestine was innocent here. When the Jews came in, they weren&#39;t exactly keen on co-existence either.
Short answer: yes.
They pretend they are Jews and yet they’ve forgot about their Torah 10 commandments: <br><br>1) I am the Lord thy god, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.<br><br>2) Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.<br><br>3) Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.<br><br>4) Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.<br><br>5) Honor thy father and thy mother.<br><br>6) Thou shalt not murder.<br><br>7) Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br><br>8) Thou shalt not steal.<br><br>9) Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.<br><br>10) Thou shalt not covet anything that belongs to thy neighbor. <br><br>They are nothing but thieves, murderers and their hypocrisy is above limit.
Many, many, many things wrong with this video. What&#39;s going on in Gaza isn&#39;t apartheid. They have a self-elected government in Hamas, which controls them. Not the Israeli government. Yes Israel has a blockade at the border, but they also let in thousands of Palestinians every day to work inside Israel. And of course you need a blockade, for security reasons. You say Israel controls the resources that go into Gaza, but no one ever asks why Hamas doesn&#39;t invest in, say, desalination plants and produce their own water, etc. I sturggle to understand why this sort of narrative keeps getting pushed, where Israel is at fault for everything, but no one seems to point the finger at HAMAS, who is solely responsible for the plight of the Gazans!!
well that explains their promotion of duel citizenship. cant afford to lose the apperance of a large israeli majority. 😮
Haven’t watched the video but given it was presented by AJ, we already know what the conclusion will be. Has AJ ever retracted the claim that Israel was responsible for the Al Shifa bombing?
Pure BS. Israel is a diverse society. Most muslim states on the other hand have ethnically cleansed themselves. Certainly no Jews allowed, and no Christians either. The plight of the so-called Palestinians is entirely their own doing, since, as everyone knows, their first principle is the eradication of Israel.
Israel+Palestine not guilty of inbreeding ?
No video no apartheid <br>One state solution Palestine
This video is no true, and spredse false information,2 mnilion Arabs live in in Israel, check you sources before you spred false info !!!!!!! shame on you !
It was a good video, but they talk about a constitution, I thought Isreal didn’t have one?  You say the areas are occupied, Israeli s claim they are not, can you go through that definition and fact analysis?  You say Isreal controls water and power etc in those areas, Isreal claims they are being generous, Gaza, for example could use recourses to build infrastructure like this, but put everything towards military tunnels etc?  Is that true?  I hear accounts, obviously, from both sides, hopefully you can answer these questions
This is complete garbage. I don&#39;t even know where to start. She claims that Israel controls Gaza. This is laughable. use some common sense. She admits there have been no Israelis in Gaza since 2005. How can Israel control Gaza with no citizens and no troops there? Hamas has governed Gaza since 2006. They control everything, including all the billions of dollars in aid money that the world gives to Gaza. Instead of using the money to help the people of Gaza, Hamas used the money to do three things: 1. Line the pockets of the leaders. 2. Build tunnels. 3. Buy weapons to attack Israel. <br><br>There is no free speech in Gaza. If you speak out against Hamas, you will most likely be jailed or killed. Anyway, I could go on all day. Pretty much everything in this video is lies and half-truths.
biggest bs ive ever heard 💀
Brings back memories the blacks in South Africa
Worse than an apartheid
People have started knowing the tip of the iceberg of what had been going on in Palastine for 75 years.People have been fed with lies all along. Zionists succeeded in hiding all this throughout.
There is no defence for Genocide and illegal occupation. This shouldn&#39;t be hard.
These colleges fear loss of Israeli endowment money.
Most of them voted Biden. Biden supports Israel... 😂😂 Biden Administration supports genocide
2 Chronicles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiLJPkHFkYI&amp;t=434">7:14</a><br>If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
John 3:3<br>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. <br><br>Mark 1:15 - “The time is fulfilled,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”
Free Palestine and islam from the world it is already written in their holy book to fight against christians,jews and also other non muslims,they victimize themselves the Palestine tv show from 2007 already openly did Brainwashing kids but broadcasting tht show.this is not just israel it may happen to any country,just like south koreans are protecting their country from religious people.when these people becomes majority they will controll you with theri sharia law which is not even suitable for humanity and this century

Free Palestine? Where can I get one?
A permit is required to conduct a procession, parade, demonstration, or athletic event in New York City. The NYPD reviews and approves or disapproves these applications. Don&#39;t be deceived! Democrats are destroying our country.
Why is USA hosting so many events of different countries&#39; conflicts?
Free palestine 🇵🇸 from the river to the sea
I can understand how students can be frustrated with mediocrity in business and the lack of good jobs that’s no reason to behave like this…Don’t  throw your life out the window over these protests. Once this is over your life will go on and this footage will be permanent and it will leave a black mark on you and your name in someway !  Walk  away from it while you still can.
Blood has been shed on both sides and none of it is okay
What baffles me is that here in America we are supposed to be one nation, yet we are so divided, if we were attacked I imagine how easy it would be for certain demographics to be despondent towards the groups attacked not if their culture or background yet we still live in the same country
Free, free Palystyne from western tax dollars
Free free America!
As a Chinese, I am for Israel as they are far more reasonable and peaceful people.
Well we need the Zionist out of US politics
free Palestine
Muslim immigrants has a lot what happen to country
Genocide comitted by Isreal n supported by G7 headed by USA...this is WHAT u hate to admit but the world has taken note of it..<br>Your media cant fool them any more..u cant hide the truth ..
Harward inoversoty shd study history again..<br>Hamaz retaliated for Isreali atrocities against Palestinians on Oct 7th..<br>So Isreal is responsible for oct 7th <br>.not hamaz
Except the so called world leaders ..G7 <br>The whole world is focussed only on free Palestine..stop genocide n arms supply..permanent ceasefire..<br>It shows you must have power to establish justice..otherwise criminals would rule the world
If u have to where a mask before u go do somthing u probably shouldn&#39;t be doing it just sayin
not one student made an issue over the 200 thousand killed in Syria, nor Iraque nor wherever the USA engages. Flakey people. They dont care about Palestibe. They are just anti zion
&quot;Palestinian civilians shouldn’t be killed by vague and unorganized evacuations.&quot;<br>&quot;Wow how can you support Hamas?&quot;<br>We say the same words but speak different languages.

This is a war of Muslims vs Jews. Imagine these people showing this much passion for God, his Catholic church and their country, we would be in a better place
How evil are those people crying because the free humans of the world are against their illegal occupation of Palestine and it&#39;s ethnic cleansing. Shame on their family who faced holocaust and did the some to others now
Free pPalestina 😢
stop equating Hamas with Palestinians
Liberals blindly supporting the most intolerant group of people in existence😂😂 classic
This is worse than World War 2.
I see how you tried to show favoratism for Israel.
Jewish or Zionist?
Free palestine ❤
Stop the genocide!
Picture of a dumb baby crying over nothing.
You did the same thing to Native Americans now you have the audacity to call Israel out
Poor stupid kids who  don’t know what they are protesting about!
The U.S. and Israel are the greatest threat to humanity.  Anyone with eyes and heart can see that.  If you want to know what evil see, look no farther.
Judaism Vs. Islam has been a war as old as Religion. 😞
I just want peace
Ignorant children. Whatever happened to the water cannons?
Hamas is the true oppressors. People who are screaming for peace and a two state solution need to understand they’ve been offered that many times in the past. They don’t want it. What they want is to wipe out all the Jews. Why someone would support that is beyond me.
We live in a double standards country , o e for the Israeli and one for all others, even peace loving Jewish people protested the killing and get arrested . We live in a police state, controlled media, and we have some corrupt  politicians that are not held accountable but regular people go to jail everyday for minor things.
You guys, Palestine protesters in a democratic country, who engage in riots and destroy others&#39; livelihoods are no better than the Israelis government. If you are vocal about it, why don&#39;t you have the courage to go to Gaza and join Hamas to fight against Israel instead of protesting on the streets? Not only protest, but also set fires and destroy other people&#39;s premises and livelihoods.<br><br>It&#39;s ironic when you protest against Israelis government but no one mentions last year the massacre and harming those Israelis. What have those people done to deserve such treatment? Are they not human beings like those people suffering in Gaza right now?<br><br>Lastly, what&#39;s amusing is when people from certain countries form groups like “Houthis” or “Hamaz” to fight against the West and their government then distance themselves from the country (except providing funding for the fighting). It is clear this way, this way they can make excuses, claiming it wasn&#39;t them and it doesn&#39;t represent their country, preventing retaliation from the West. Unlike North Korea (DPRK), whose leader has the courage to speak up for their actions. Now, this is call gutsy, unlike those gutless and coward nations leaders.   <br><br>On the other hand, it would be interesting to find out what those leaders from countries like Iran and Russia, along with their propaganda comrades, would say if the West did the same and formed groups fight against them and saying it&#39;s wasn&#39;t represented the country.  Can the west or other nations do the same?  Clearly not....Such a “double standard” as what the CCP said. <br><br>Israel government may not be right involve with the bombing etc,. but those fighters (should say the country army) in Palestine or Iran are no better.
This student have nothing with situations, they need to be in class. We are adding to the last day which was in the Bible Prophecy
Israel right-wing government is pure evil
🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
The same is happening to a much lesser degree up here in Canada too. At least those students are being allowed to communicate to one another outside by holding up signs and while talking to one another maybe too loud for some people next to them to hear however at least they are not being coerced into having to help manufacture bombs, bullets, cigars, etc. I hope they all pass their university courses no matter what side they picked to be on outside there at the time instead of later ending up having to do the other manufacturing for the military sort of thing in order for them to make a more decent living instead of worse - Ending up being coerced into having to work in the prostitution industry or else.
Both sides are at fault tho most act like hamas is so innocent remember Israel didn’t start the war hamas did im not with either side i personally think this war should come to a end too many innocent casualties on both sides
LEVE PALESTINA
Why are the israelis protesting, when biden is already listening to them💀
嘎！中国网友来评论一波，我觉得大家很理性吗

To all real Americans, born and bred Americans, these are two peoples fighting in your country🤣🤣🤣
Bro Palestine just killed alot of israel people and those israel people are standing up for Palestine what idiots
Caucasoides return to Europe, the original inhabitants throughout the world are reclaiming theirs.
Free Palestine Allahu Akbar
And the Jews thought racial and religious minorities were their friends.  What ye sow, ye shall reap.
The entire pro Palestinian argument is this <br><br>“Listen, they say this land is theirs and not Israel’s so it must be! That means they have the right to enter Israel unprovoked and start gunning people down!”<br><br>“What? Israel doesn’t like that? Evil! Tyrants!”
You&#39;re in America... America supports Israel if you don&#39;t like it, leave the country, and do something about it.
Would you believe that absolutely none of this will resolve the conflict? Not the protests, Not Israel&#39;s bombardment, not the Palestinian&#39;s support of Hamas, no diplomatic appeals to honorable compromise; there will be no peace so long as the 3 Abrahamic Religions consider that particular region of the planet to be Holy.
Another way of division.  This is what the global elliststs want
NBC is in Israel&#39;s pocket. Shame. Boycott NBC programming
free palestine
Free israel from all the arabs
Yet another reason for Americans to choose to be divided. Let’s focus on what’s happening here and fix it.
Noticed how the pro Israel  kids are more chill about this then the pro Palestinian kids?? <br><br>Anyone else notice this??
Free Palestine
Why are the pro Israel so peaceful, and the pro-pals look scary and dangerous
🇦🇪🇯🇴🇪🇭🇱🇾🇲🇾🤫🇪🇬🇪🇸
It&#39;s so hypocrite from Palestinian side , first you commit genocide, and then you want it to stop because all of a sudden it&#39;s in your own disadvantage? Stop crying, you reap what you sow.
What about the wrong inflicted by Israel for the last 75 years. Where is the Jewish students sense of justice!
🇮🇳🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸❤❤
This is lead by inept universities and worthless “instructors” who believe their asinine personal opinion instead of teaching. Defund all institutions who want to preach instead of teach!!!!
Free Israel
Support Israel
Give your life to Jesus. He is the way the truth and the light ✨
At least the Jews have jobs....Doctors..Lawyers..Dentists..The Palestinians  are all on Welfare..or..will be..Scammers
Israel crocodile&#39;s tear
Why don’t we treat Muslims like we did in 2001
My family is a member of the “Christian Zionist” cult. As far as they’re concerned, blind obedience to the mini-state of “Israel” is what brings god’s blessings(yes, small g). I on the other hand have known for a long time that “christian” Zionism is a carefully crafted intel operation of US intel, Mossad and globalists. Jeff Epstein and G. Maxwell’s father were(are) operatives.
College students will be college students. Quick listen to them, they know it all. When they leave and start living in our world they will know what we know. When they start thinking for themselves and not the way their friends do. They will realize how dangerous Islam really is.
Just take notice that the Palestinians are screaming and ranting when they are the ones who started the war while the Jewish rallies are people crying, begging for the lives of their friends, and singing in unison. All I’m asking is that you take notice of the difference in the reactions of both sides
Definitely more pro Israeli voices were heard in this news story…biased story. One thing I learned from this story is that I am sorry I sent my kid to NYU. I guess the university does not believe in free speech if it criticizes Israel. Israel is now, and rightly so, being accused of genocide. I would never know this by mainstream media. That’s why I switched.

The most brutal conflict in the annals of history
Its not a war, its genocide.  The usual side playing the victim card. This didn&#39;t start on the 7th October.  Decades of brutal oppression of the native people of the Holy land. <br>Stop the slaughter.  <br>Boycott the apartheid state.  BDS.
The Americans are losing their hold on the Middle east as their pet thugs, the Zionists, lose their war on every major point and their former allies begin to smell the fear in Tel Aviv and in Washington as the world condemns their colonialism, racism, genocide and crimes against humanity. The world will not forget or forgive the heinous crimes of the american and israeli zionists. This is a genocide. It has nothing to do with the aggressors alleged rights to commit war crimes or americas crimes of aiding, arming, abetting and diplomatically protecting genocide and crimes against humanity.
Trump: PEACE IN ISRAEL/GAZA/ME FOR 4 YEARS. PEACE/ECONOMIC DEALS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND SOME ARAB NATIONS.<br><br>Biden: WAR 2 YEARS AND 9 MONTHS AFTER TAKING OFFICE, WITH NO END IN SIGHT, MARCHES/DEMONSTRATIONS WORLDWIDE(NOT SEEN DURING TRUMP YEARS).<br>FAILURE OF US PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP.<br><br>Democrats....Biden!!!!
Divide and concur
Palestine will be free
As the grandson of a Schutzschaffel (SS) Totenkopf (deaths head) division I see no difference between SS Nazi ideologies and Israeli genocidal aspirations.
Most people consider this situation as two groups of scumbags killing each other. When the only people of value deserving love and compassion are the the child victims.
I just met a family from gaza came from Ireland had two beautiful babys came to me said God told them id feed them it broke my heart im struggling bad financialy and being evicted but i gave them 60.00 i dont say it to brag but to say this war impacts families  and little babies and if i can help so can you if we all help we can make a difference i hate hamas but i have a heart the Palestinian ppl are innocent and caught in the cross fire and its not fair may God bless them all i wish i could only do mor e
Some say international law is being violated.  But where was the international law when Israeli was attacked and hundreds kidnapped?  You didn&#39;t see UN peace forces coming to their rescue.  Big talk.  Lots of posturing.  So who cares what the UN says?  All those women and kids you see in the news photos -- how many of them are fathered by or sleeping with Hamas?  Did Hamas suddenly go celibate?  You don&#39;t hear them asking Hamas to surrender.
free palestine🍉
Praying 🤲🏽 for Palestine 🇵🇸 to be free from 😶‍🌫️ settlers!
Wait are you telling me you want to give a room in someone’s house your trying to steal. What the heck they mean by offering the people a State it’s their land.
Funny AF some of the same Americans I head bitching about the power outage and being worried about an invasion, and being invaded via border wall are the same ones supporting Israel invading and killing innocent people. Now they wanna flee the US because they don’t like it. 🤣🤣🤣 how. Fing. Ironic. Ohhh how the border walls have turned.
Trust in Jesus today as your savior from hell. Christ is the only solution to the sin problem in our world and the eternal penalty as a result, which is ultimately part of our nature passed down from adam and eve due to their rebellion against God. The good news is that there is a savior from the penalty of sin that God the father sent, and that is his only Son Jesus Christ, born of a virgin and without a sin nature like the rest of mankind. The father established the Old Testament law, which was morally perfect to show man&#39;s imperfection in attempting to keep it. But Jesus, being perfect, kept the law perfectly, thus fulfilling the law. However, he didnt just fulfill the law, he also died on the cross as a substitute for all mankind&#39;s sin. The penalty for sin is death, so God sent his own son to pay the penalty for Mankind so we dont have to go to hell. The lake of fire is referred to as &quot;eternal/spiritual death&quot; so when Christ died for you and me, he satisfied the father&#39;s wrath against our sin. Afterwards, he was buried and then rose again after 3 days, conquering the grave.  He did this so that mankind can recieve eternal life as a free gift, all you have to do is believe it was done for you. The gospel of john states &quot;He that believeth on the son hath everlasting life, but he that believeth NOT the son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him.&quot; Believe in the original Greek language translates to &quot;pistueo&quot; which means to entrust, in this case, to entrust ones eternal destination to Christ. Ephesians 2:8-9 &quot;for by grace you have been saved through faith, and not of yourselves it is a GIFT of God. Not of works lest anyman should boast.&quot; Simply believe what Christ already did for you to receive eternal life.
A two-state deal is insanity by definition. The Palestinian people have 70 years of proof that they are not capable of  autonomy or peace with anyone including neighboring muslin countries like Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran , Iraq, or Lebanon. They need to homogenize with Israel.
All TERRORISTS
STOP THE PALESTINIAN HOLOCAUST BEFORE IT&#39;S TOO LATE!!!😮
Hamas is using the Palestinian Muslim people as human Shields for their terrorism and Egypt is where Hagar and Ismael came from and The Egyptians have closed the boarder to Egypt on their own people The Palestinians.
If Egypt takes back their Muslim people who are The Muslim Palestinians They won&#39;t be in a War zone acting as human Shields will they ? . Blame Egypt for closing the border on Hagar and Ismaels children who came from Egypt.
The Muslim Palestinians are Egyptians from Hagar and Ismael. Egypt has been reluctant to take back their own people.
One Palestinian Muslim in Gaza Israel is too many !
Gaza Israel has certainly vomited out the Palestinian Muslims ! . Hager and Ismael came from Egypt and that&#39;s where they will return to.
The Muslim Palestinians don&#39;t have a country anymore and they have the nerve to talk about good faith ? Insanity ! . The Muslim Palestinians have forfeited Gaza back to Israel under The Land for Peace agreement. They have no country anymore. Hager and Ismael came from Egypt and that&#39;s where they belong. Or to one of the other 7 Arab Muslim Nations to live.
The lack of aid and all deaths are on Hamas. Israel is going above and beyond for their enemies. Hamas is stealing the aid!!!!
Zionist FOX propaganda,  israel is a naz!$ state with Fuhrer Netanyahu as the head
La palabra majica desprogramacion mental de los egregos de gerra
How many Hamas terrorists Palestine died dead,?? How many civilians Palestinians dead? How many Hamas terrorists are in prison since October 7th? And aid is dropped from sky and trucks went in with food as many reports videos show and show Hamas taking food and shooting their own people can you show more of Hamas actions not only israel
Who fact checks the figures provided by Hamas and that are accepted by so many as being the Gospel truth.?<br>Some say the UN but from my understanding it relies on the honesty of Hamas and accepts whatever Hamas gives.<br>What interest would Hamas have in providing lower but truthful figures and a breakup of what is included in whatever figure is given when the higher the better is a sure winner?
You have to say Hamas death. Not to say Palestine death. Hamas terrorist live in public. Almost death are terrorists.
No aid, no state
👏👏👏👏
This is a lying propaganda channel, don&#39;t believe them people.
😢😢😢😢
You guys know that it would only take three countries to tell Hamas to stop or they&#39;ll kick them out of society and this will all be done
Praying for lsrael 🇮🇱🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
What about all of the missing under the rubble?
America is main culprit and Israel and Britten are Main wild terrorist country in the world
We do not care about you idf forces
I stand with palestine
Israel is Teririst
Israel finish the war Hamas started! UN also failed along with UNRA.
isreal uk and america stop killing little babys.
Well 70 % is Hamas so not big toll of civilians
It defies critical thinking that so much of the media, the UN and all the parroting Western political officials are ready to trust a terrorist entity&#39;s &quot; casualty numbers&quot; with a dogged tenacity.
Where is the independently objective verifiable evidence for these casualty figures supplied by Hamas, its apologists and sympathizers? Certainly not the so called aid agencies, UN, or hamas journalists would dare to contradict these &quot;numbers&quot; which accumulate with magical alacrity.l..in minutes..in a few hours. Where are the names of these &quot;thousands&quot; of victims? Why not publish them with the same alacrity? I am waiting.
Still dancing and celebrating???? Why not???
I used to feel bad about the holocaust, not anymore.
so the islamic Nazis of the Gaza Strip, you know the ones that were democratically elected and are PART of the UNITY government of Palestine, the one recognized by 138 nations of the UN, the one that invaded, raped, murdered, dismembered, burned babies alive, slaughtered over 1240 innocent civilians on purpose, shot over 400 young girls in the vagina then kidnapped 235 who they continued to rape, executed, starved and torture have lost 30k of their people?  15,000 actual &quot;fighters&quot; killed a couple thousand of their own (cause they shot 15,000 rockets into Isabel at civilians and 2,200 landed short and killed their own) and who know how many are hamas in civilian clothes? those folks, who STILL hold 134 hostages and say they will do oct 7th over and over and over again?    tell me when they reach 300,000 dead til then? I could give a rat&#39;s butthole
Ya Allah Distorted Israel I hate israrel
I just find it so strange that Israel has blamed Hamas for these attacks. I have my doubts. How is it possible all of a sudden Israel are finding these tunnels. My gut tells me Israel have committed these attacks themselves and Natanyahu the murderer just wants to remain in power.
Israel 🛑 stop wornig 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸👍
Things changed.  Israelis are not coming to the table with piles of concessions any more.  Hamas is shocked.
It is not Hamas war, it is Israeli genocide. A well armed army vs mostly civilian. shame
Holy month of Ramadan?<br>Holy?
To be exact, 29000 Palestinians/Hamas terrorists/Hamas supporters/Hamas terrorists&#39; family members and their children.
Hamas terrorists death toll.
Dear Palestine,<br><br> please leave the Religion of Islam to end sufferings
Is FOX NEWS now in the half truth reporting business? Israel cannot make any compromising deal to get the hostages because if they do every Israeli citizen would become the new Middle East Currency all the any terrorist group has to do is to capture Israeli civilians to get any deal they want and in regards to the aid for Palestinians, food shortage has been exacerbated by Hamas hoarding of food, fuel and medicine, as much as 25% of the supplies entering Gaza are  been take by Hamas we all seen the videos and report so why Fox is not talking about it.
&quot;Palestinian&quot; death toll is the count as given by Hamas.  &quot;Palestinians&quot; are terrorists.<br>Keep that in mind before you start phrasing crap that is terrorist propaganda.  There will NEVER be Hamas or &lt;insert terrorist group name here&gt; in the Gaza strip again.
TRUMP IN 2024!!
Israel occupied the Palestinians 75 years ago. Why do the Jews pretend to be victims when the whole world sees how the Israelis behave violently towards the Palestinians? The Gaza ghetto under Israeli control was completely demolished by Israeli bombs. The IDF killed 29,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Entire families were buried under the rubble, people were driven south to Rafah and were told that it was a safe zone? However, bombs are also thrown at Rafah? In the West Bank, the police arrest Palestinians every day, including women and children. Thousands of Palestinians are in detention. Israeli illegal settlers are stealing land from Palestinians, burning their houses, driving them out of their homes? The apartheid state of Israel can only survive if it destroys the Palestinians!
Israel is killing the innocents of gaza and isreal is very cruel and they dont have any ethics.
I guess the number of Palestinians Sinwar wants to be killed hasn&#39;t  been reached. But he lives with his family in a tunnel.
29000 including about 18-20 battalions of Hamas terrorists?
Any proofs?
29000 dead atleast half of them are HAMAS and people trying to call it a genocide 😂
Leave it to fox to call it a war
For I never know that Jah made some of his people to be born. Jah never make some from wood nor stone and the others from mud n fresh n blood you know, Don&#39;t think  so, Free! free again. Do Jah set aside?, Free! free again. Rastaman hold on, All nation want to be free.
No no Israel
Save people Palestine
Save Palestine
Free Palestine
No usa
Where is the PROOF?
isreal has killed too many innocent palestinian children and babies and fathers and mothers grandpas and grandmas and animals and much more isreal you are not a winner in this world everyone knows that isreal kills innocent palestinians if you kill babies and children Israel must stop killing innocent Palestinians
It&#39;s shocking how American media and politicians managed to dehumanizing Palestinians and glorifying Israelis Altough Israelis are an occupation and killers while Palestinians are resisting and fighting for their land back.<br>Palestinians just like Americans are Humans too, Innocent children, naughty children,  doctors,  criminals,  elderly people, athletes,  scientists,  pupils, drug abusers, politicians,  corrupt people,  good people, honest people, liars... all kind of people just like any other nation.<br>I feel sorry because Politicians and media managed to twist facts for some regular people to support and stand on the wrong side for the politicians own benefits and goals, without your hate they cannot keep the war going, without your hate they cannot sell more weapons and create more wars. In the end of the day Palestine is a nation of all kind of people good and bad, You hate them because your politicians want that when it comes to Israel I&#39;m sure your mind won&#39;t accept this fact that Palestinians are totally right and Israel is totally wrong. Since when occupation was right and resistance was wrong.
maybe if israel stopped blocking food trucks...
Free palestine
29 000 in total. 17 000 are at least hamas
It’s a war! Death toll will go up what the phuck do you expect?gazans are just lucky it’s not Bashir Al Hassad attacking because the death toll would have been at least 290000
Isreal doesn&#39;t care about the hosatges that is 2nd on the list. It is busy committing  war crimes, and the getaway clause is one word &#39;Hamas.&#39; How can Isreal evil crimes always be forgiven under the pretext/claims of  Hamas. Over 100k injured, more than 30k murdered, ethnic cleansing, and genocide prevails. They want more😮 This is the modern age holocaust faced by the Palestinian civilians witnessed by the world😢 No justification is acceptable for murdering children, babies, families, etc.
The numbers are fake, everyone&#39;s wearing a green bandana on their forehead in the tunnels, if not physically then mentally and willingly. All were caught on camera cheering on kidnapping, abuse, and horrific acts against Jews.
29000 according to whom?
Genocide! In the Ukraine-Russia war we never saw Russia nor Ukraine soldiers attack children and women. But Israel ?? THOUSAND PALASTINIAN CHILDREN killed in just a few days. Clearly Ethnic Cleansing is never about Hamas
Can you please for the sake of humanity and truth and facts separate out the # of Hamas terrorist deaths from civilians. This is the most basic requirement when reporting on any conflict worldwide. Why this basic fact is missing from every single western media outlet is shocking irresponsible and directly supports and promotes motivates and legitimizes terror groups worldwide and Hamas specifically in this conflict. I expect Hamas to lie as they always do as well has the Hamas controlled health ministry as well as all these Hamas compromised NGOs. But never did I expect this to be adopted by every news channel without any concern for this huge important fact that is not only your job but also your obligation. DO BETTER. Please. Now.
You lot in the media really need to quit pretending those who are &#39;still in the area&#39; are not Hamas soldiers. Get real.
Random question, why is it automatically assumed that if ww3 were to be happen “it has to be nuclear”? How would anyone know that it’ll be nuclear? Why does everyone come to that conclusion? Y’all are saying it wouldn’t be fought with guns at all?
29 000 -10 000 =15 000 CIVILIANS  AND 10 000 TERRORISTS DEATHS  ,THE MEDIA KEEPS SAYING THAT THEY ARE ALL CIVILIANS, NO ,THERE ARE  ONLY 15 000 CIVILIANS CASUALTIES  THE REST ARE TERRORISTS.
People suffering from both sides and war for land instead of that it should be for humanity let peace be with people suffering and may almighty grant good life for all ❤
Cannot wait when the US stops supporting your little country (like they always do).  You will be the next Ukraine or Iraq or Afghanistan.  That’s a PROMISE! Taxpayers are already upset, and the politicians are stalling to approve more aid to save their own butts.
What crime Israel hostagees caused due to Hamas continuos detaing Israel hostagees.<br>Why Hamas to release hostegees with conditions.<br>How far hostegees are lengthy detained the more deathe would toll &amp; Hamas to lose their live intensely.<br>Richard Maribu<br>PNG Christians.
There are 100 of drunks sitting at the boarder and the UNRWA organization and others have not been able to keep up with it. This is unfortunate but wrong information. Hamas is additionally trying to get hold of the deliveries and taking his share before he feeds the starving Palestinians. Shame on Fox.
So much for the &quot;thou shall not kill&quot; and for &quot;the chosen&quot; people living as an examplary people after revenge murdering 20,000 women and children in Palestine. Might be quicker if they just build showers versus forced starvation.  NO AID TO ISRAEL. STOP THE GENOCIDE!
I&#39;m oh so broken up about these Gazans, who voted for and supported their terrorist masters and are now paying the price. They&#39;re actually lucky it&#39;s the IDF they&#39;re up against. If it was Jordan&#39;s king or Syrian dictator Assad they were up against, there&#39;d be 100k Gazans dead by now, if not more.  How do I know? Read the history of Black September in 1970 and the Syrian civil war that began in 2015. The Arabs have no sympathy for their enemies especially when it&#39;s their own kind they&#39;re up against.
hamas a gangster gang.  Men who hate women, life, children.
Gof bless  Isreal
Yes, the United Nations is corrupt
Dont give gifts to people who wish to do you harm.<br>Remember, Battlestar Galactica !!
Hamas leaders are living in luxury abroad. Why are they not feeding the Palestinians who voted them in?
29k, 20k of those are terrorists
there are 500 trucks just sitting in Gaza and aid agencies have not been able to distribute that aid. Israel has no limits on aid to Gaza
How can you possibly believe and stupidly quote Hamas figures.
How about Hamas surrenders and hands over the hostages?  Don&#39;t we think that that may stop the casualties of war? Something that seems to have escaped a lot of wandering minds.
Anchor woman says viewers are concerned about humanitarian aid for Gazans. This viewer is concerned about the lack of humanitarian aid--including much needed medicine--for the hostages. Why don&#39;t you ask about that humanitarian aid, anchor woman?
We destroyed the Nazis because they were racial supremacists and they were exterminating people that they didn&#39;t want in their country, now the entire world is watching these racial supremacists doing the exact same thing to the Palestinians, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE? THERE IS NONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Free Palestine
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔Serious question: Is it actually terrorism to resist or fight against a nuclear power occupying force thats keeping you imprisoned and building settlements in your own home or land that you&#39;ve lived on for thousands of generations????  The people who call themselves Gewish all trace their roots back to European nations and leave the mythology of the bible out unless you have proof that the people in is-real are the Israelites of the bible which there is no proof today.  So ive been trying to find what others think. Can you be considered a terrorist in your own home if i break in and hold you hostage and you fight me back? Can i call police on you for assault???? Remember im only asking because im trying to see from all sides of the issue 💯😢😮😮😢

Good girl
I was born in and live in Australia, but my great grandfather fled the April 9th massacre in 1948. His child (my great uncle, who’s 80 or 81) can remember it from when he was 5 years old. He was being placed with his siblings in the boot of their car with a mattress positioned over them to help stop the bullets. That’s how desperate the situation was. I don’t like Hamas, because they’re beliefs and actions in general and on October 7th are terroristic, however, I definitely don’t like the IDF (or as I like to call it, the Israeli Devastation Force) either.<br><br>Free Palestine 🇵🇸
MOTi
This shows that there are some innocent jewish people that are being publicly attacked and killed because of their country&#39;s own reputation. And this is their source.
they literally invaded. the Palestinians are the ones that don&#39;t need them

All good people Israeli people is a good man is a good everybody good
All the inhabitants of the land of Palestine, including Muslims, Jews, Christians, Jewish Samaritans, and others, coexisted there for several centuries. Several empires and kings passed through this region, their religions were different, their states fell, their authority was gone, and none of them ever abandoned their original inhabitants. The evidence is that all the churches of Palestine are still the same, including the Church of the Resurrection.  It has been like this since the time of Jesus, peace be upon him, and history did not mention that thing or that anyone abandoned someone because he changed his religion until the announcement of the establishment of the Jewish State of Israel in 1948. Since then, everyone has been bleeding from all religions, so you must stand on the right side and expand your circle of knowledge.
We need peace for once..
